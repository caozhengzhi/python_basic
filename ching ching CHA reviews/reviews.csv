Robert M.,"Evanston, IL",5/19/2017,5.0,"A man sitting on a step nearby this place told us to try it. We did.it was amazing. Not that there is any connection, but I have a Chinese wife and have lived many years in China, and this food is nowhere there. It's now tied for #1 best chinese while straight (that I've tried), the other being in lowly Villa Park, Illinois. Both places have less than stellar facilities, and the staff isn't special, but the food is just great."
Michelle P.,"Washington, DC",5/9/2017,4.0,"When I stepped in, it felt like I was being transported to Hong Kong, this place is as Asian as you can get.  There's even a display of tea pots and cups and other things for sale. I ordered a blooming flower tea and my friend got a pur err which is basically what I'd like to call the whiskey and bourbon or wine of the tea world since they age it for so long.And like anything aged, it's great for your health although on the medicinal side. When you order the pur err you get a tiny tea ceremony if you are looking for a ""zen"" experience. How it works is they give you a pot of hot water and a tray with a tea pot, a pouring cup and a tea cup. You pour the hot water in the tea pot and wait for it to seep, then in to the pouring cup so the tea won't over seep, the pouring cup is called the ""ocean of tea"" and from there you pour it into the cup... which I forgot the name of. Occasionally you'd want to give the tea pot a bath in hot water or tea so it would maintain the temperature or if you are like me and just like playing with your food! If that's the case buy a tea pet, go ahead and google it then thank me."
Chris D.,"Centreville, VA",2/18/2017,5.0,"This is place is a GEM!You can walk by it without even noticing it but it's a must try. Neat little shop where they're selling teabags, pots, and other traditional Chinese items. They have table seating and a small padded floor seating area which all sits in the store itself. They serve wonderful small plates, dumplings in particular and the tea selection is great! Slightly pricy but nothing to complain about. Great experience! Will definitely be back again!"
Michael L.,"Seattle, WA",4/8/2017,4.0,"This place was great! It's a little place right next to Filomena's on Wisconsin St. My lady and I went here for tea on a weekday morning and I've never been to a place just for tea. I can't remember which tea I ordered but it was $12 and lasted through 8 pours. There are tables throughout the place to sit and enjoy your tea, but we opted to sit down next to one of two low tables where you need to take off your shoes. Overall, love this place!"
Amber G.,"Arlington, VA",8/16/2016,4.0,"This place is pretty weird.... It doesn't feel like it belongs in Georgetown and at first glance it looks more like an Asian antique and herb store than a place to sit down and eat. On top of that there's that name: Ching Ching Cha. Can't help but chuckle. But ""cha"" means ""tea"" in Chinese so we'll let the ""ching ching"" part slide I guess....This is actually a great place to come if you enjoy tea - they have something like 70 different options to try and bags of dried tea to buy to take home. It's a very quiet and open space inside that actually feels pretty calming. Lots of rosewood and overhead skylights.  The food is tasty and really healthy. You can get a ""tea meal"" for $14 which comes with three veggie sides and a main entrée. I got the miso salmon, cucumber, snow peas, and cabbage and was pretty impressed. The salmon was steamed and so moist and the veggies were mostly served raw but with really flavorful soy sauce/sesame-based sauces on them. They also have small items like dumplings and chicken rolls. I also got an apple flavored iced white tea for $4 and it was a pretty huge glass of it. Not too sweet and you can really taste the quality of the tea. A cute place to come in Georgetown for some quiet tea or healthy Asian food options."
Genesis D.,"Washington, DC",1/28/2017,5.0,"Great tea house experience! Went here for Chinese New Year for kicks and giggles with this company. There was no special for Chinese New Year, which is fine. The lotus moon cake was surprisingly good but they pineapple square was soooo good too. Yum!! I had the chrysanthemum tea and chicken roll. Both great."
Janice D.,"Glen Echo, MD",10/16/2016,5.0,"One of the few places in Georgetown -- or DC in general -- where you can be far from the madding crowd and find some peace. And Fabulous tea. (Which are the same thing, I'd argue.)When you enter, you'll be in a little entryway that pulls you in with a beautifully cultivated selection of porcelain teapots, other teaware, and sparkling clean little bins of loose tea. I've found some wonderful, truly unique gifts for tea-loving friends here, including serious (and seriously beautiful) tea canisters decorated with gorgeous cherry bark.Move in further, and you can hear the gentle music, and not much else. It is hushed and relaxed. The skylight above the small yet open dining area adds to the calm.The food is simple, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The menu isn't wildly extensive, but there has always been something delicious for each of the lucky friends I've introduced to this oasis. There are vegetarian options, though to skip their sparkling fresh seafood (especially perfectly prepared salmon) would be a shame. Flavors are well-paired, inviting you to eat slowly and mindfully.And the tea! I'd been searching for a good, full-bodied pu-ehr tea to help me curb my coffee habit, and with guidance from my server, found the one I'd been missing for years, and priced comparably to the online specialty tea shop from which I'd previously purchased.Go and soothe your harried DC soul!"
Victoria H.,"Washington, DC",4/3/2017,5.0,"This place makes for a lovely Chinese tea time. They serve meals and tea snacks in addition to a full menu of teas. I like sitting on the floor (they provide floor pillows) and you take off your shoes so you can get really comfortable. They have regular dining tables as well. Each tea order is for an individual patron, but they provide you with an endless heated pot of water so that when you finish your first pot of tea, you refill your tea pot with the hot water and let the tea steep again. Each pot of tea is good for at least 6 refills, which makes for A LOT of tea. You get your money's worth with each pot of tea ranging from $6-$18. My favorite tea is the Eight Treasures tea. It has dates and goji berries and flowers and longan--they give you a spoon so you can eat them at the end, although they taste a little diluted with all the water they've been soaking in. The only food I've tried here is the marbled egg, which is only $1.50 per marbled egg, which they slice into fourths. It's a little salty, but I think it's delicious and served with sesame oil. I've seen other patrons bring in their laptops and do work while drinking tea, so this serves as a study cafe as well. I've enjoyed tea for a 2-3 hours here at a time, so they do not rush you (although I came during the weekday when it wasn't busy)."
Alyssa B.,"Washington, DC",8/27/2016,4.0,"My family and I used to come to ching ching CHA often when I was a kid (about 15 years ago), but stopped going when the food started to go downhill a bit.  Recently, we were in Georgetown and needed a nice place for lunch that's not too expensive.  We remembered ching ching CHA and decided to give it another try.  We're so glad we did!  The prices are pretty much the same as 15 years ago (a huge bonus, since most places increase their prices over the course of a decade or two), but the quality was actually better.  My mom and I both had the chicken curry tea meal ($14).  It was lovely and consisted of the main dish, rice, 3 veggies, and soup.  The flavors were simple, but tasty.  My dad had the cold noodles which were delicious as well.  The food here is pretty authentic for a Chinese tea house in the U.S.  It was similar to tea meals I've had in Taiwan (although Taiwanese and Chinese teas are quite distinct from one another).  It's definitely a far cry from the Americanized orange chicken and kung pao beef often associated with Chinese cuisine in the states.  The food here is quite healthy and light-- low sodium, low oil, and steamed.  My biggest issue was that they told me that I could have the apple jasmine green tea without any sugar.  I'm not a fan of sugar in my tea, so I ordered it that way. When it came, it was still SUPER sweet.  It turns out that when they said ""no sugar"", they meant no additional sugar, but the apple juice itself still has a ton of sugar in it.  It's a little misleading.  They replaced my drink with a regular iced Jasmine tea with no sugar.  This time, it was significantly less sweet, yet it still had a sugary aftertaste.  My guess is that they dumped the original drink out and added the new tea in without rinsing the glass out.  Not super impressed by that.  Other than that though, the tea was good.  Service was polite and friendly.Overall, a good and unique find in Georgetown.  Like many have said it has a cute and relaxing atmosphere, as well.  If you're in Georgetown and you're in the mood for something a bit different and reasonably priced, head over to ching ching CHA!"
Alan V.,"Washington, DC",4/3/2016,4.0,"Found this place via Yelp and figured we should try it out since we were close by. At first, when walking through the front door my friend and I felt as though we were walking into a vintage bookstore. As we progressed through the entryway, a waiter quickly appeared and welcomed us to a table.Now the interior of this place threw me off a little. I hate using this word, but it was very oriental. I swear there was a scent reminiscent of incenses which is odd because it's a tea place but maybe that was my mind messing with me. Off towards the center of the cafe/restaurant were a variety of books and tea available for purchase. We were seated off to the side of the restaurant at a table. Behind me were lower wooden tables with pillows as seats instead. My friend and I ordered the peach blossom and harmony tea, as well as vegetable dumplings and the pork roll. The peach blossom tea was served in a glass mug/cup, and the tea leaves slowly blossomed as time went on. The harmony tea was served in a small tea pot, and we were provided with one small tea cup to pour the tea into. I wanted something fruity, so when I tried the harmony tea I wasn't disappointed. The tea was sweet but not too sweet, definitely retaining the bitterness that tea leaves are known for. My friend and I noticed that as time went on, both of our teas became more bitter which of course makes sense, but for some odd reason passed our minds. The food offered was mostly appetizers, consisting and things you see at many other Chinese restaurants. The dumplings weren't completely mind blowing, as well as the pork rolls, but as appetizers they served their purpose. And as they were coupled with tea, it attributed to creating a lax atmosphere, in addition to the regular decor. One thing I would have liked more would be a bigger food selection (entrées) since we were starving. But it makes sense since this primarily a tea house. Also, I know this place operates off of Chinese culture, but I almost felt as though the entire place was created and marketed as... too commercialized. Lastly, the lighting was a little too dim for where we sat, as compared to the other side of the cafe. Overall though, this was a nice place to relax and catch up with friends. The tea was great, and everything felt warm to the heart. If I was in the mood, I would definitely come back!"
Willie R.,"Washington, DC",7/24/2016,5.0,"Ching Ching CHA is wow, wow, wow! It's like stepping foot into a tranquil zen garden. From the peaceful music to the overwhelming sense of calm that permeates the entire place, I felt so at peace here. When you walk in, it almost feels like it is not a restaurant, but once you come through the entrance area, you'll find the tables in addition to the teas and accessories. Our server was very kind and took the time to explain how to properly steep the tea, and even poured it to ensure the proper steeping time. I enjoy the tradition that comes with the practice of serving. The menu has a great variety of teas, most of which are in the $6-12 per pot range per person, and it also features some healthy snacks to accompany the tea. The lamb dumplings were awesome and has a nice little spice to them. We also enjoyed the dipping sauce, which paired well and was not too heavy on soy. If you find a tea you love, you can also purchase some tea (or pots, etc.).Everyone is very knowledgeable and can help you find just what you're looking for. Aside from that, I had a fantastic experience here and look forward to returning. Most tea shops in D.C. look and feel like shops, and Ching Ching CHA does a great job of being an actual tea house and restaurant at the same time. Kudos. Can't wait to come back!"
Toya J.,"Greenbelt, MD",1/12/2016,4.0,"I love this place as soon as you walk in you can feel the essence of calm. People are quietly having intimate and engaging conversations. You look to the right there is an assortment of loose leaf teas and other tea related products for purchase and to the left and around a divider lots of open seating. There is lots of space between the tables, which is nice because you get some privacy.We were seated in an open area, and behind us is a space where you can remove your shoes, step up on a platform space and relax on a few pillows (on the floor) and drink your tea at a coffee table.This tea house has lots of dumplings to choose from, apparently they must be good, because when we sat down around 6 pm, the dumplings were all gone. So I went with 2 croissant  pastries one with chicken on the inside, the other with beef. They were pretty good/average, but I much rather to have had the lamb dumplings. *the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.Next time!There is an art to the way tea is served in Asian culture.The staff is very kind and patient; both of these virtues are displayed here as our server came over and carefully poured our tea and told us precisely when we should add more water to our cups. They know exactly when to come by and check up on you without interruption. Lovely.....my peach blossom tea opened up right in front of me, so beautiful to watch. A work of art and nature in every sip!The sign of true tea mastery is when every round of tea tastes exactly the same and at ching ching CHA there was an un-cut ribbon of flavor with every cup. So worth the trip!"
LanChi N.,"Fairfax, VA",1/17/2016,4.0,When in Georgetown it seems like my bf and myself always have to enjoy a cup of tea and the fun part is whenever we go to Ching Ching Cha... we always try a different one. Then again how can you not considering there are so many selections. We still have yet to try food selections there but they always smell so good perhaps at the next visit we will try their tea and bento combination.The staff here is always so attentive and friendly and i love how they tell you how to brew each individual tea since  not every method is the same. I don't think I've tried a bad tea here and I love that they have an option for tea on the floor with patted pillows. I always forget to wear the right shoes so its easy to take off...But  there is always another visit.They also have a lovely selection of loose leaf teas that you can purchase in bulk  along with different tea pots and cups.Favorite tea  was definitely the first one we tried which was the harmony tea.It was amazing how there was no added sweetener but the fruit inside the tea gave it a natural fruitiness and sweetness.For those who are tea snobs and just want an all natural warm beverage this is your spot. Whether you need to catch up with a friend...need to grab lunch read a book be zen with yourself. This place is peaceful enough to do so. Truly a georgetown gem.
Kathryn M.,"Washington, DC",4/10/2016,5.0,"My favorite tea shop in the DC region. Very authentic, with great service and really good teas at very reasonable prices, given the quality. The setting is lovely and tranquil, and the small food menu is full of tempting options, prepared quickly. The food seems to include healthier options than most restaurants - less that's fried and full of butter, etc. I've really enjoyed everything I've eaten here, and the selections really complement tea well. Perfect for lunch or a light snack.I keep coming back here, for good reason. The people who run this shop really are delightful and they will pour your tea for you at your table according to precise methods to ensure you get the best experience of the teas. They also sell loose leaf teas, so if you find something you enjoy, you can take it home with you. Lastly, they have an extensive teaware collection that is really quite remarkable and probably worth a visit in its own right.I have sampled all the serious tea venues in the area -- and there are plenty here that are impressive -- but I give Ching Ching Cha my unequivocal endorsement: it is the best."
G L.,"Leesburg, VA",5/20/2017,5.0,Very nice experience on our first visit. The staff was courteous and the tea was of great quality and served in proper manner. The food was priced reasonably and tasted very good. We even get to buy some tea serving accessories for the house. They have pretty much everything you would need.
Reiko B.,"Washington, DC",5/12/2017,5.0,The white imperial tea is so delicious. Gentle and divine.  And the Mongolian dumplings made of lamb are great! Also had the cold noodles. A gem in Gtown! Cannot believe I had not been here before!!
Simone B.,"Gaithersburg, MD",4/7/2017,2.0,"This place has tasked themselves with exploiting a very limited concept, and therefore finds themselves in the situation of having to charge $10-15 for a cup of tea. While they have a very interesting and bountiful tea menu, this is not the place to come to if you are hungry. They have one substantive meal option, and a few other options as far as snacks go. My advice: eat before or after, and maybe even brew your own tea when you get home to save some dough."
Grace C.,"Clifton, VA",5/7/2017,5.0,"Wow, a semi-hidden gem despite all the hot reviews on yelp because I don't know many others on campus who are huge fans. The restaurant is so unassuming but so accommodating. I had a tea meal for dinner: tomato soup for starters, and a bento box style main meal with Savoy cabbage, snow peas, Korean squash, mapo tofu, white rice and pickled carrots. That was probably the healthiest yet simultaneously most satisfying meal I had out of all the restaurants I've tried in Georgetown. Our server was incredibly gracious, and taught us how to prepare our tea. I had some kind of jasmine tea, and I drank about 8 or 9 cups just to get my money's worth- and the tea is worth it because they offer ten refillable POTS of hot water for free. My friends and I stayed there for hours, and the manager and other workers were so kind to us even despite our long stay. The restaurant is clean as well, which was a bonus. Definitely will head back next year when I'm back in the area to try another tea and another tea meal. Also tempted to buy one of the many tea and food related items they sell in the back."
Murat O.,"McLean, VA",4/28/2017,4.0,"Amazing small tea shop in the heart of Georgetown. They have a great variety of teas and although a bit expensive, I think the experience is worth it. Will be dropping by in the near future."
Jen K.,"Seattle, WA",12/12/2015,4.0,"This is a unique and quaint little shop with some cute tables tucked inside a tiny shop selling tea and cute related accessories.The service is wonderful- very polite and friendly and welcoming!The food is great too. We had a little bento box that was perfectly and lightly seasoned, flavorful, and delicately presented. The teas we had were wonderful. Very true to the titles, and not overly sweet or 'dolled up' like American teas. They were pure and strong and enjoyable.I would highly recommend this place for an afternoon snack or light dinner with a friend. It's quiet and quaint, perfect for good conversation and lots to look around at in the shop itself.Would definitely return if Im in the area again!!!"
Trista G.,"Los Angeles, CA",4/11/2017,5.0,What a great place. Traditional Chinese tea with lots of choices and great dumplings & bento boxes. Perfect lunch in Georgetown. An experience you don't get anywhere else.
Jane W.,"Fairfax, VA",4/19/2017,4.0,"We arrived around opening time on a Saturday, and was one of the two groups there. They don't begin serving food until noon and I wish we knew this before we came. The tea was great! Service was slow, but that just seemed to be the overall atmosphere of the place. I ordered one of the floating lantern teas that was suppose to open up into a bright pink flower. When it opened, I was disappointed to see that the flower was white.. they said they ran out of the bright pink ones so they gave me white one instead (flavor was supposed to be the same). Still, I was a little disappointed that they didn't tell me beforehand and that's why I gave it four stars."
yy f.,"Washington, DC",10/7/2016,4.0,"this place is such a hidden treasure and gem-- an oasis of calm where you really feel transported. i have probably walked by a million times and never thought about going in. i went with a friend and was just ""wow""-ed. first, the store front looks small but its actually spacious with huge ceilings and skylights, on a sunny day its so charming. there are regular tables and chairs and an area to sit on low tables on the ground and take your shoes off. it is NOT the kind of place you go for a quick bite to eat of a quick spot of tea... these guys move slow, but once you mentally adjust to it, its alright. the place is also super quiet-- like library voices quiet, which is hard for me because i am naturally pretty loud, but it worked out. we tried the ""Eight treasure"" tea- which i liked the more it steeped--- at first i thought the flavor wasn't strong enough, but over time the natural sweetness of the raisins and fruits seeps in and the tea becomes sweet. also, you are given a spoon and when you are done you can eat the plump and warm raisons and dates and wolfberries-- soo yummy and a total delight. its supposed to be soothing and mood enhancing and i really think it was.we also had Yunnan Gold Needle-- served in a unique style with a small cup you were constantly having to add hot water to the little pot and let it steep for a minute and a half-- it was amazing! a strong black tea with an almost chocolatey feel to it.Last but not least we had the beef curry puff (yummy, simple, a good snack), and the chicken dumplings (they took forever to come out, which makes me think they are super fresh) and they were really delicious standouts I am definitely hoping to go back and explore more of the tea menu and the food menuThey also sell teas, tea pots and books and other cute things... Anyhoo, what a great hidden treasure :)"
Emily M.,"Washington, DC",3/24/2016,4.0,"If you like tea, you must come here. It is tied, or maybe even better, than the arguably fabulous Capital Teas.The tea is phenomenal, but what makes this place stand out is the experience it offers. There are various seating areas. I sat on a cushioned floor, my legs tucked between a traditional floor seating table. It was a homey and intimate way to share tea with friends. The tea was unique and delicious. I did not order food, but most certainly will next time! The cultural tea books, cute chopsticks, and other items for sale make for good souvenirs or gifts. During the day this place is popular, but late in the evening you can have a quieter meal or tea session. The only reason I am giving it four stars is the price. $6 + tip for a pot of tea was more than I'd like to pay. However, it is specialty tea so maybe the price is a value. I suppose one has to know a little more about tea before making that type of observation. Regardless, this is a lovely place which I shall return to!"
Taariq M.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",6/3/2017,2.0,"Unbelievably overpriced tea, even considering the luxurious nature of some types. Not even ordinary meal."
Sherry F.,"Elkridge, MD",6/22/2015,5.0,"Stopped by for a cool drink on a hot and humid day and got a hibiscus tea w/sugar for myself and a jasmine green w/o sugar for the bf. We got them ""to-go"" so I can't speak to the food/menu or customer service, but the cashier was polite and friendly, all smiles. Each drink was $2.50, with $15 credit minimum. The drinks came out in a few minutes, and both were crisp and refreshing. My hibiscus was tart and sweet with floral hints...perfect thirst-quencher for the weather. My bf enjoyed his jasmine tea as well; steeped perfectly with the roasted flavor of tea without being too overpowering.Wish we weren't in a hurry...I would have loved to check out all the loose-leaf teas and teapots and other tea related merchandise they had displayed...maybe next time! :]"
Avery C.,"Rutland, VT",1/7/2016,5.0,"One of my favorite tea houses in the Washington DC area, I always look forward to my visits here when I am in the area. The tea is amazing, the food is wonderful, and the staff is always attentive and helpful. I love bring people new to the tea house experience here because I know they will enjoy it and the staff is always more then happy to explain the process of enjoying specific types of teas.The only downfall at Ching Ching CHA is there are only two zashiki style seating (sit on floor at low tables) configurations, all the the rest of the seating is traditional western style table and chairs.I will be back again and again! Thanks for the wonderful experiences in the past, the present and in the visits to come in the future!"
Farnaz S.,"Washington, DC",3/1/2017,5.0,"My absolute favorite hidden corner in Georgetown. I have been there several times and I always leave the place with joy and satisfaction. The Variety of really good quality and well presented teas are remarkable, the staff are sweet, attentive and patient. The place is beautiful, calming in a zen way, clean and more importantly quiet, the food is simple and healthy and delicious, the pastries are to die for and fortunately very different from all other places. I love their vegetarian bento box and the lovely tomato and tofu soup, I adore their Lotus seed pastry which has a very unique taste and the sesame seed dessert is really delicious. Every time I am impressed how beautifully they present the tea and how patiently they describe the specific ritual and way of brewing and drinking each tea. My favorite blend is ""Chinese Mother's Wisdom"", it's a must try. This beautiful place also has unlimited wifi and it's such a pleasant place to read a book and magazine on your own or catching up with a friend. I don't recommend it for large group of people and I personally never wanna go there with a large crowd. Part of the unique character of this place is the calmness it offers in a crowded place like Georgetown, I don't like to ruin that :)"
Jon L.,"Manassas, VA",3/28/2015,5.0,"In a word...unique!Cate and I were thinking of walking the trail at Great Falls. I mean it was 74 degrees yesterday...today it was like winter wonderland. So, since it was Saturday we decided to check out this place after reviewing several Yelp posts.We did the traditional chinese tea service, removing our shoes and sitting on the floor, with pads of course.Our Server Man Yee was so very nice and helpful. She explained the various tea's and the menu and made suggestions. Cate had the Jasmine Blossom and I had the Jasmine Pearl They were both just terrific. We shared the Salmon with Kale & Cabbage and we each had a bowl of Miso soup.What a great way to spend a Saturday lunch and make it a special experience.I would highly recommend as a way to entertain out of towers."
Cristina C.,"Bethesda, MD",2/25/2017,5.0,"Words will not do this place justice; so I will keep it brief. The most consistent little place to have a light fare and savor delicious teas. Their dumplings are the best I have had, and the service is impeccable (in typical Asian fashion). This is a MUST if you are in the area. Always on point, great ambience, and high quality and unique. Truly a GEM."
Socheat S.,"Alexandria, VA",1/14/2016,4.0,"As I walked into the tea house, the little corridor definitely reminded me of the traditional chinese restaurants in NY. It was a nice oak smell, full of tradition. I wasn't sure what to do as I walked in bc all you saw as you walked in were tea. A gentleman walked up dress in the traditional Chinese outfit and said his greetings. There wss floor seating and table. My backed ached so I chose the table. :)I wasn't very hungry but I couldn't help but order some food. I had the vegetable dumplings.  Nothing fancy, simple.  My friend had the curry bento box so I tried some of her veggies.  The kale and cabage were cooked enough to hold the crunch and was flavored with a soy dressing. It was refreshing.  Now for the main reason for coming. TEA TEA TEA...The energy of the place is very nice. Serene,  grounded and complete.  I loved all the different type of tea sets and cups. It was like walking to a museum of tea! I had the 8 treasure tea. Medium flavor, lots of different ingredients but not bitter. I enjoyed it. It was nice, I can't say much about the other teas but I look forward to trying them all!"
Lee J.,"South Miami, FL",9/2/2016,5.0,"This is my favorite Chinese tea shop in US. My company is very close to this tea shop, so I visit Ching Ching cha a lot. The tea here are as good as China. I compared the price with the tea price in China, and they are about the same. I love sitting here and order Chinese dessert and also a cup of tea. I love the eight treasures in winter, and monkey King in summer. The dumplings are good too, they are slightly different from dumplings you will find in most Chinese restaurants, but they are really good."
Jeffrey L.,"Omaha, NE",1/13/2016,5.0,"A wonderful find in the Georgetown area. Thanks to Yelp. I liked the ambience of this tea house / restaurant. Looks rather like a Chinese tea house. :) You have an option of a table or floor seating with pillows. I had the mapo doufu bento, and the Ginseng Oolong tea. They explain the Chinese tea preparation wth the supplied tea ware (also for sale). They offer 70 variations of tea. The food was really good especially the green tea mochi. I will return if I'm in the area again."
Luna J.,"Madison, WI",8/4/2016,5.0,Great teahouse for reading by yourself or chatting with friends. I love their afternoon tea set. I tried the Mongolian dumpling and marble tea egg and I would definitely recommend the marble tea egg! It's authentic.
Devi D.,"Baltimore, MD",4/29/2017,5.0,"A hidden gem teahouse just off of commercial georgetown! I recommend the Eight Treasures tea and often end up ordering a bento to share and spending an hour relaxing and snacking. They also have a small store with teacups and chinese books for sale, as well as selling tea leaves to take home."
Cat T.,"Annandale, VA",12/16/2015,5.0,"On a hot summer day, strolling through Georgetown, my friends and I saw this place and decided to check it out. My friends were looking for a place to eat and I didn't mind where we went. Although, we didn't stay to get any food, I got some iced tea to-go.When I walked in, I felt like I was on the set of some Ang Lee film, as it faintly brought to my memory, that one scene from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, where the main female character was fighting off the group of men (sorry, inner film geek speaking). Of course the settings were not similar although it gave me that authentic vibe. I was amazed by how they decorated the interior with such fine furniture that seemed to be vintage from the tables to the chairs and even the stage area for on the floor seating. I liked the atmosphere and the unique quality this place possessed. The firecrackers hung on each of the side of the room were a nice touch. I liked the skylight and the way the lighting poured in over the room. It really made me feel quaint just being there and surrounded by the smell of tea leaves and very beautifully made tea pots and cups. Well, aside from the eye-catching and captivating aesthetics, I enjoyed the flavor the the jasmine tea I ordered, with no sugar, of course. It was truly the dark and strong flavor of tea that I'm used to. Being the tea enthusiast I am, I can't wait to come back and try more teas and other things that this place has to offer. I am already thoroughly impressed with the interior design by itself. Great place to visit in Georgetown, if you're looking for something new and don't mind a little culture."
Megan C.,"Irvine, CA",7/19/2016,4.0,Traditional tea room. Good if you want to experience that type of ambience. Personally I prefer Taiwanese tea.Their lamb dumpling was good.
Maureen C.,"Oakton, VA",4/24/2016,5.0,"Oh my, this first experience was better than expected, even after reading all these rave reviews! I highly recommend this place to any tea lovers out there.  I tried the monkey king green tea and the jasmine tea, definitely loved the monkey king, and the price is worth the show given on how to make the tea starting from washing the leaves and warming the cup!  The food was also spectacular! I tried the bento box with chicken curry, loved the kale, tomato soup that came with it, and the curry! And the mongolian lamb dumplings, mind blowing! Beef curry roll is very good too, but definitely get their mongolian dumplings, drooling right now thinking about it"
Megan H.,"Germantown, MD",11/16/2014,3.0,"I'd prefer stopping in to pick up some tea to go next time. It's cute inside, but with tables in close proximity to one another, it's difficult to have any sort of intimate conversation. If you're not familiar with traditional tea, it is worthwhile to check out their tea service. It will vary with your tea selection, but if you happen to select a tea with fresh tea leaves, they'll wash the tea leaves with an initial pour of hot water before allowing the leaves to steep."
Christine M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",6/23/2016,5.0,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! I was just wondering around Georgetown looking for a quite place to read.  I pass this place almost everyday on the bus so I thought I would stop in.  I loved it.  Super pricey, but welcome to Georgetown.  I sat for 3 hours and had 2 separate pots, but I could have easily just had one.  I had some oolong and some green tea.  I was sooooooo hyped up after.  Granted, I was sitting there for 3 hours reading and drinking tea."
Sabrina B.,"New York, NY",11/21/2016,5.0,"Such a cute tea house. The tea was awesome, and the dumplings were even better. I felt like I was in a different country -- wonderful experience."
Tiana Y.,"Bellevue, WA",6/26/2016,5.0,"This place is just wonderful! Everything is perfect and reasonable priced . Highly recommend tea with dessert, if you wanna try authentic Chinese style things. (I love pineapple square most:) Tea is fresh and teapot is cute too. I didn't expect the food at a tea house at all, but both the tea meal and cold noodles are great! I will definitely come here again when I visit D,C. next time!"
Jackie B.,"Lorton, VA",8/30/2014,4.0,"This relaxing little nook was perfect after a busy day walking around Gtown. I ordered the Apple Iced Tea to cool down and it was so refreshing and delicious. The bf and I also got the Monkey King green tea ($15). It's the smoothest and most pleasantly tasting green tea I've tried. Not bitter at all! Pricier than the other teas, but we thoroughly enjoyed the taste, and the technique of brewing the leaves was novel and fun for us. I also loved the tea cup - the outside stayed cool so no burnt fingers.I'm a huge fan of anything with a flaky croissant-like crust and their Curry Beef Roll and Chicken Roll ($5) are no exception! The meat-filled pastries came out piping hot and were flaky, tasty, and comforting. This tea house is great for a light lunch and we really enjoyed a break from the hustle and bustle around town."
Janelle V.,"San Leandro, CA",12/8/2014,4.0,"If you're really into tea - and I mean authentic Chinese teas, not tea bags like Lipton where you can just throw it into hot water and call it a day or generic teas from your everyday cafe - you'll love Ching Ching Cha. It's not only a tea house, but also a shop where you can purchase tea as well. AMBIANCE: The moment you walk through the door you're transported into a very peaceful and tranquil environment. You can choose to either sit at a regular table or sit at a lower (more traditional) table setting where you take your shoes off and sit on pillows. My friend and I opted for the table option, but if I were to come back I'd definitely want to try sitting there.PRICE: The price varies upon which tea your order. I ordered the Floating Lantern tea, which is considered an artisan tea and costed me about $7, but since you can keep refilling your cup use the same leaves/herbs/etc. a few times, I'd say you get your money's worth. Plus, I'm not 100%, but I'm pretty sure you can purchase the tea in their gift shop area if you really LOVE it or have a tea in mind. TEA: I really don't see how you can go wrong with any tea your order. Obviously if you like a more hearty tea then ordering a black tea would be best versus a lighter green tea, but it's all personal preference. There are so many tea options at Ching Ching Cha, it definitely was hard for me to come to a final decision. Also, there's a teapot at each table that is filled with hot water that your server frequently refills. FOOD: I can't tell you much about the food because quite frankly, I didn't come here hungry or even expecting there to be any. However, there ARE food options. I say if you're hungry or want to try something, do it. OVERALL? This is definitely an authentic tea house and it's a nice tranquil environment to unwind in. I went here on a really cold night and it was a nice escape from the chaos of reality. The service was also pretty good. Our waitress answered all our question about why the establishment was called ""Ching Ching CHA"" to what was her recommended tea options. She was also very attentive and changed our teapot that held hot water very frequently."
Meika U.,"Arlington, VA",12/1/2016,5.0,"Long story: I came here with my mother a few years ago. I had a tisane and the tea-soaked egg while she had the monkey king tea and a salad. It was refreshing and calming and a few months later, my mom was diagnosed with cancer. It wasn't a particularly dangerous cancer, so I sent a care package in lieu of rushing home, and she asked me to send some of that magical green tea. So I trekked to the shop and asked the server who got the owner to come out and talk to me. She said she had flown to Taiwan to get this tea and she would only give me a couple ounces and apologized for the cost. My mom was so pleased and said it was comforting during her radiation therapy. Then I switched jobs and made new friends and my routines never took me to Georgetown. I wandered around Teavana and drank PG tips and an occasional bag of Tazo, when I decided I wanted better. When I read a post on serious eats about buying good tea online, half the shops he talked about sounded familiar. Serious about tea, personal relationships with growers in tea regions, specialized, travels to hand-select tea... So I trekked back to ching ching cha. When I opened the door, I was enveloped in the scent of tea and spices, instantly calm and quiet. I found the genmaicha I was looking for, browsed the vast selection of tea accoutrements, and sat down. The food is minimal - designed to compliment but not overpower the tea. The servers are there to teach you how to do the tea prep correctly. Be prepared to have a meditative experience. The methods of prep for some of the teas are intended to allow you to experience the full, subtle dimensions of each variety, which requires focus and patience. You won't be hurried. If you are looking for the real deal, you won't be disappointed."
Mckendree T.,"Rosemont, IL",5/8/2016,5.0,"Incredibly restful and an unforgettable atmosphere. Take a break from shopping and order the ""harmony"" cup of tea"
Jane T.,"Alexandria, VA",7/18/2015,4.0,"Love coming here for tea! It's on the pricier side but it's real tea. The deserts are good too. But, I wouldn't eat the food here. It's not that great. Come here for tea only."
Alice W.,"Fairfax, VA",6/7/2014,4.0,"Passing by Ching China Cha on a fairly regular basis these last few years, I've always chuckled to myself whenever I read the sign. The name is something left to be desired, really it should be somewhat offensive, but apparently Ching Ching is the name of the founder of this tea house. Offensive name or not, this place is a lovely, quiet place to enjoy some tea. First off, this place is a legit Chinese tea house. It's very open and lofty. There's plenty of natural sunlight seeping through the place from the overhead skylight. When you first walk in, you see various teas and accessories from teapots, mesh balls, and tea canisters. To the left, there's platform seating with comfy cushions where you sit cross-legged, without shoes. There are also tables and chairs, made of rosewood. Overall, the atmosphere is restful and undisturbed. They serve over 70 different kinds of teas, from green, black, oolong, tisanes, white, scented (jasmine, strawberry green, Earl Grey), and even pu-erh. Two oz teas range from $4-32, depending on the kind of tea you're ordering. In addition to teas, they also serve dumplings, chicken rolls, soups, sweets like tarts and cookies, and whole entrees like curry chicken, tofu, and miso salmon. They also serve iced teas (grapefruit, apple, grape, jasmine green, hibiscus) for $4.50. I got an apple iced tea (it's actually apple with jasmine green) and it was perfect for the hot weather outside. For $4.50, I got a pretty large glass of iced tea. As I mentioned, they offer a range of tea accessories, including books, teapots, tean canisters, mesh balls, tea cups, and other teaware. This tea house is a great place to go if you're in the mood for traditional tea or want to sit serenely and enjoy tea/snacks. I certainly wouldn't mind popping back here for some traditional tea next time."
Wilson T.,"San Francisco, CA",9/6/2016,5.0,"Awesome snacks. The tea set for $8 is a pretty good deal and the chicken dumplings I had were delicious! The iced apple tea (less sweet) was just right for a hot summer day, refreshing and just the right amount of sweetness with a strong tea flavor. Would come back and try some other teas another time! Hidden gem in Georgetown!"
Jenny P.,"Washington, DC",1/11/2016,4.0,"Took advantage of my personal day and spent it here and around Georgetown. For worry-free parking we went to garage next to CB2 via the Spothero app. We were the first ones there on that dreary morning and spent 2 minutes trying to decide whether to peel off our soggy shoes or to take the regular tables. When we finally settled on the tables, we were greeted by sweet ladies who recommended the Chamomile Tea. For starters, we ordered the veggie dumplings (liked that the filling had noodles, but no remarkable flavor) and marble tea eggs (takes 3 days to make, tasty- but crazy overpriced). I ordered the chicken curry with snow peas, squash, and kale and my friend had the all veggie version. Our food took a little long to arrive (though we were warned) and I was accidentally presented with the salmon dish. Glad I said something, because the chicken curry was so comfortingly hearty I wanted to drench all my veggies in the sauce. Also, THE KALE was so good- crispy and sweet after having been boiled and blanched.  Overall, definitely not the best bang for your buck, but you leave feeling refreshed and without additional layers coating your arteries. Would like to take my family here because I can't think of another place quite like this in the area."
Derek A.,"Washington, DC",9/25/2016,4.0,A different and interesting experience. I have never been in a tea room before so didn't know what to expect. Their jasmine tea is so good.
Kamya R.,"Washington, DC",10/16/2016,4.0,"Definitely a bit more on the pricey side, but this place had great dumplings and an amazing ambiance (very calming and serene), especially for a good conversation over tea. I had the Imperial Silver Needle tea made up of buds that open up as the tea is steeped, very cool to watch! I'm not a dumpling expert, but all three types of dumpling, the vegetable, mongolian (lamb), and chicken dumplings were all very fresh."
Valentine A.,"Paris, France",3/14/2015,5.0,"As a tea lover, I can say that this place is just perfect. During a rainy Saturday stroll in Georgetown, I stopped in for a bit of warmth. This place is half loose tea shop, half tea salon. Everything is done in the Chinese traditional manner, which was fascinating to me, as I was never initiated to Chinese tea rituals.They have regular tables, and a couple of low tables where you sit on cushions. Welcome change of scenery from the DC busy life - take off your shoes, sit on a cushion, and put your worries away.Their tea list is a great selection of all kinds of teas, for all tastes and all budgets. I treated myself to an Iron Goddess of Mercy. My waiter was extremely pleasant and helpful, showing me how to use each of the tea utensils that my little tray came with. The whole ritual is enjoyable - by focusing on the different steps, you put your thoughts away for a while. And the tea was exceptional, of course.I also chose a marble egg, for my tea break. Great savory afternoon snack, I loved it."
Andy L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",8/12/2015,4.0,"Situated on a relatively quiet street in the midst of bustling Georgetown, this place offers an excellent getaway. The place serves authentic tea imported from China and Taiwan. If you want to experience tea as it ought to be served, drank, and savored, come here. I guarantee you will enjoy the tranquility here. It's also appears to be a great place for a date."
Alanna D.,"Dallas, TX",10/26/2016,4.0,"I went with a friend on a hot day in the middle of the day. It was so quiet and peaceful and to have hand served tea in the bustling city was incredibly refreshing. It's not just lipton tea. It's an experience. You take your shoes off and sit on pillows and it's totally worth it. DC prices so it's incredibly cheap but it's definitely reasonable. You can also get teaware, books, and other knick knacks and stuff. Totally worth it."
Ipek S.,"Toronto, Canada",7/21/2015,5.0,"From the moment you walk in, this place embraces you with its calm, relaxing zen atmosphere. It is in the middle of the crowded part of the town yet very far away from all the kaos outside. The food is very simple and original, none of their ingredients are boring nor overdo. The carrot salad was very simple with rice vinegar and a nutty sesame oil, absolutely delicious. The tomato soup was just the right portion and tasted smooth. You will have a hard time to pick between all the delicious tea flavours but I recommend the fruity ones. Since it's a slow paced restaurant you can find some time to chat with your server and learn about the history of that place. Apparently they have been running for more than 15 years! The service was nothing less than the food, and the hospitality with reasonable prices makes this place a definite regular spot."
Carol L.,"Washington, DC",11/22/2015,4.0,"Loved the iced tea mixed with fruit juice! I got the apple (with jasmine). So refreshing and tasty! AND it came in a giant glass (like German beer garden boot sized).The Bento box was decent, especially the curry, although the vegetables were a bit bland. Mongolian dumplings also good, if you like lamb. They're not as juicy or tender as pork dumplings."
Yosef K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2/2/2017,5.0,"Tranquil, almost magical space right on the river. Fantastic selection of tea. I got the rooibos (I know, kinda basic) but it was superb. Prepare to spend more than a couple bucks. But the tea kettle keeps on giving. And you can make yourself a generous to-go cup!"
Andrea B.,"Columbus, OH",2/13/2015,5.0,"Call me a huge fan! The atmosphere inside is so calming. I love the entire teahouse experience of removing your shoes and sitting on cushions on the floor, it's all incredibly relaxing and peaceful atmosphere to meet up with friends.They offer a wide selection of authentic Asian teas. I was surprised to see so many on the menu, it was pages and pages in length. I usually go for one of the blooming teas that open up right before your eyes as the flowers seep in hot water. Plus, the people that work here are all extremely nice and the food comes out super quick."
Gustavo C.,"Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",3/22/2016,5.0,"What a hidden gem! Food is great, ambient is awesome and the teas are off charts. To go and spend some time worry less...Kudos for the waiter. What a sweet girl..."
Morgan F.,"Washington, DC",2/17/2015,4.0,Great place to have some tea and conversation. Everyone I've taken here has enjoyed it!
Grace K.,"Washington, DC",2/1/2016,5.0,"Here is Oriental Chinese tea place. Tea is really delicious. I recommend Oolong tea. Additionally, the bento box is very organic. I ordered mochi ice-cream for my dessert. It is also delicious!!"
Rebecca M.,"Washington, DC",11/15/2014,5.0,"I am in LOVE with this little Chinese tea house nestled in to a busy pocket of Georgetown. For the past 7 years I have walked by this restaurant, always meaning to stop by, but never quite pulled the trigger. Boy have I missed out.As the other reviews note, this is an authentic Chinese tea house and gift shop. There is a raised platform area which as other reviews mentioned, consists of cushions on the floor and low tea-tables. There are other areas for seating throughout the shop, which when we visited, were all taken. The food menu is small but everything we got from it was delicious! The chicken dumplings, the vegetarian dumplings, and the Mongolian dumplings were all lovely. And the cold noodle salad was scrumptious! Everything tasted very fresh and lovingly prepared.The tea selection was FANTASTIC! Everything from green teas, to herbal tissanes, to 'Chinese Herbal Remedies'. I could have stayed there all day trying out the different teas. The one thing of note: they don't offer sugar or other 'Americanized' accompaniments for tea. Finally, the service here was SO friendly! The woman who was serving us reminded me of my Chinese Grandmother. Petite, friendly, and kept coming back to make sure we had plenty of water. Everyone else was also friendly and helpful. I'm glad to have finally checked this place out---and plan to go back as often as possible!"
Mary S.,"Escondido, CA",1/18/2016,4.0,"Super cute interior, with the option of sitting on mats in a traditional Asian setting. Plenty of tea and cute teapots also for sale. Food was FINE not the best but not the worst, nothing exemplary. This place seems to be better known for their tea, which I'm definitely going to try next time. Staff was nice, and pricing was decent and expected for Georgetown."
Dani P.,"Arlington, VA",10/31/2014,4.0,"It was years of going to school and working in Georgetown before I realized this place existed. It's not hidden, but it's so unassuming along Wisconsin Ave that I'd walked past it constantly and never noticed it. That's not a bad thing though. When you walk inside, they've created a peaceful environment that makes you forget you're in the middle of DC. You can sit at a table with chairs, or take your shoes off and lounge around a lower traditional table.The prices depend on the quality of tea you choose. You're paying for the tea, but they'll bring unlimited hot water for you to continuously refill your pot. It's a little expensive and they don't let you share teas with your group. The snacks are tasty, but also expensive. If you're hungry, it's probably better to eat somewhere else first before coming in here.They have lots of the items they serve for sale. You can browse through a huge selection of tea accessories and teas. Despite the tea on their menu being expensive, the bags of tea they sell are cheaper than Teavanna."
Chely May R.,Australia,3/15/2014,4.0,"What a cute little teahouse!Ching Ching Cha is not just fun to pronounce, but actually fun to visit!Browse their little selection of nick nacks, and grab one of their old school style Chinese tea tables if you can! We didn't get one but it was still fun hahahThere's so many selection of teas, and the shopkeeper will demonstrate what you need to do to completely enjoy them. One of our tea needed three rinsing each time we drank it. It was fun.Don't forget they also have some tea time snacks. Our pick was the soy sauce marbled eggs."
Melissa M.,"Springfield, VA",6/19/2016,5.0,We had a lovely experience here today. The menu is very small but the portions are filling. The staff educated us on the various teas and how long to steep them before drinking. The ambiance is charming and location convenient from the water taxi and parking garages.
Gillian B.,"Centennial, CO",7/9/2016,5.0,The waitstaff was so friendly and helpful and the food was great. Tea choice was fantastic.
Therese T.,"Annandale, VA",1/18/2015,5.0,Best discovery ever in Georgetown! It was here that I was introduced to the flower teas. I ordered Floating Lantern and spent the next 20 minutes admiring how beautiful it is. It was delicious too! Not very strong but I didn't expect it to be. The atmosphere is cozy. I could literally could spend hours here and you see other people was indeed there for a long time. That could also be a bad thing since you would have to wait a long time before seated. It didn't deter me since I wasn't in a hurry but I saw a few people left while waiting. The staffs are amazing! So polite and nice. I had my eyes on the floor cushion seats but they were occupied. The waitress put us at a regular table but promised us to move our setting to the floor seats once it is free. It took FOREVER for the other customers to leave but it was worth the wait! We ordered dumplings and some other appetizers to munch on with our teas. The food were good but the emphasis was really on the tea. I highly recommend this place if you want to escape the busyness of Georgetown!
Kelly K.,"Columbia, MD",12/23/2015,5.0,"One of my favorite places in Georgetown. I would go through the traffic just to come here. So peaceful and people are so nice too! Their flower teas (white teas) are refreshing, and of course you can't miss out their oolong tea!!"
Juli N.,"San Antonio, TX",1/1/2016,4.0,Wanted to just sit and relax with my boyfriend because we were bored downtown and didn't have anything to do for a 2 hour time block. Happened upon this place and ordered the tea and dumplings. The tea was too notch and the food was authentic and well done as well.  Atmosphere was the best part though- we sat and used the Wi-Fi and it was just a great spot to unwind and chill for a while.
Laura G.,"East Hampton, NY",12/27/2016,5.0,"It was delicious, clean and a fun concept. Both the savoury and sweet crepes were delish.  Only problem was that eating the crepes was messy."
Marcela C.,"Washington, DC",1/3/2015,4.0,"I've been a couple of times to this place I can confidently say that it has been awesome. While the room is not the coziest at first (it is also a tea shop), once the tea arrives you forget about everything else. Service is outstanding. The waitress told us everything we needed to know about the tea and its process of preparation. I particularly liked the blossom teas (see the picture that I posted) because they are very unusual and a whole experience. You can see how in a matter of minutes beautiful flowers blossom in the water. PS: The desserts are delicious. Especially the rice cake filled with ice-cream."
Cherelle H.,"Washington, DC",8/26/2014,4.0,"Great little spot tucked away in Georgetown! I went here with a few of my co-workers and we got the Box Lunch Deal, which was about $14. It came with a choice of protein and choice of 3 veggies. Very tasty. And probably the best Kale that I've ever had. I had the salmon with kale, squash and cabbage. It also came with a starter soup which was good also.I did not try any of their hot teas but I did order an iced apple tea to go and it was amazing! I will definitely go back and try their teas and the rest of their menu."

Updated review",5.0,"It's been about three years since I reviewed Ching Ching Cha and a lot of things have changed since then. One, Teen Mom is no longer a documentary about the lives of teenage parents but a straight up train wreck (Did you hear about Farrah?!?!? YIKES). Two, Rob and I are now engaged. Three, not only am I *FINALLY* Elite but I also work for Yelp now! Craziness.One thing has not changed though and that is my unwavering love for ching ching CHA. As an Asian-American I feel like I should be outraged by the name choice of this venue but when you walk in you will actually see that this is an authentic Chinese tea house and gift shop. In my last review I lamented that a pot of tea for one person ran in the $8 - $15 range. This is still true, but if you come between 2:30 and 4:30 pm on a weekday you are eligible for their ""Afternoon Tea Special"" which allows you to get their tea of the day and four of their homemade dumplings for only eight ducks. A steal, I tell you!My Chinese black tea was the perfect pick-me-up for the middle of the day work sesh and my Mongolian lamb dumplings were super tasty as well. What was even more enjoyable was the sun filtering through the high skylight ceiling, low tables, and comfy pillow cushions I was sitting on. I had brought my computer and camped out for about two hours with almost no interruptions. My server only stopped by every 30 minutes to make sure I had plenty of hot water to refresh my tea.Love, love, love, love this place!  And the best part...no shoes lounging policy! Can I live here?"
AL K.,"Fairfax, VA",12/24/2013,4.0,"TEA house with a nice concept where you can choose from a menu of  variants of tea and side dishes.You can either sit on the ground with pillows as cushion or at a regular table. The store also sells different variants  of teas, and accessories. Good to try for the experience."
Ching H.,"Washington, DC",6/3/2014,4.0,"2.50 for some banging iced tea! Dirt cheap prices, so refreshing, and lightly sweetened. The grapefruit tea was my favorite, hibiscus, and jasmine were good as well! I seriously can't get over how refreshing the tea was, for Georgetown prices, this is my new spot for when I need to quench my thirst, and the tea is so much better than Starbucks!$15 DOLLAR MINIMUM for card!"
Laura K.,"Manhattan, NY",5/12/2015,5.0,"Such a lovely tea room in the middle of M street, a perfect spot of tranquility where you'd last expect it! I came here for lunch today with a friend. We shared three dishes - chicken dumplings, chilled noodles, and crunchy salad - the portions are on the small side, but it left me feeling content, not too full and not too hungry. It's also a refreshing change from the typical American Chinese food which is greasy and overly sweet (which has its own place in my heart, of course, can't live without my occasional dose of General Tso's haha). We both got hot teas, my friend got the jasmine pearl and I got the peach blossom, which was one of those teas where the flower opened up in the hot water and it was just lovely.The service here is extremely nice, our waitress was patient and explained how to steep our teas, and kept the kettle of hot water on our table filled, all with a smile. We sat there chatting for a little over two hours and she didn't rush us in the slightest. Throughout our lunch there was only one other table that was occupied at a time, as well as occasional customers buying teas, and it was just perfect for us to enjoy a peaceful slice of the day. I almost don't want this place to become more frequented because it would really be a shame if it became overcrowded and lost their feeling of oasis. But I think it's such a great place to take a friend, it's very calming and just what you need sometimes to restore your inner peace!"
Sally M.,"Washington, DC",4/27/2013,5.0,"I was pretty stoked to see that this tea house was still open upon my return to the DC metro area in 2011. Back during my first time living here, I'd grown enchanted by this tea house - in part because I've always been enchanted with Asian cultures, and also because I love tea, and also because I love the idea of a real tea house. (Yes! You must remove your shoes to sit up in the proper area where one sips tea - on the floor, on cushions, just like so.) And there are dumplings. And other food I must return to try. Circa 2007, I'd purchased their passion fruit black tea and Earl Grey. Delicious. I also purchased two small, air-tight canisters for storage. Today I came home with a variety of goodies. I sampled the white peony in-house (also: hey! livestrong.com/article/5…). I purchased the lychee jasmine tea for home. I came home with a yellow Tisaniere - brilliant! How have I never seen one of these before? These are perfect! No more loose leaf tea infusers to stuff & cram tea leaves into. Instead, I now have a permanent, easy, cup-like one - built-in! And it has a lid to keep the tea warm! This is perfect for my desk at home :)To top it off, they had *JUST* the house (in my case, hotel) slippers for which I've been looking tirelessly for months. I've searched high and low - in brick & mortar stores, online, and even purchased some handmade slippers online via Etsy - only for the seller to never ship them (yet take my money), and I had to escalate to my card company to mitigate, resolve, hold the seller accountable, and reimburse me. Needless to say, when I saw these simply, leather-soled, house slippers - including a case - here for only $28, I was ecstatic! Lots of crossing-off of to-do list items on this vist. Most pleased."
Teale R.,"Ann Arbor, MI",4/11/2016,4.0,Delicious and healthy! The staff was very attentive and accommodating. We really liked the salmon and veggies!
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",3/11/2014,5.0,"I visited ching ching CHA with a few friends on Sunday and really loved it!  It seems like a very authentic Chinese teahouse experience and is located conveniently on Wisconsin Ave in Georgetown.  The four of us took off our shoes (they're quite strict about that) and sat at a low table and sipped on amazing tea.  I ordered the Harmony tea, which came with passion fruit, apple, and orange bits.  It was a perfectly sweet flavor.  I normally do not like tea very much, but the Harmony tea was fruity enough for me to enjoy.  This teahouse is a great place for groups and it's a perfect place to visit when it's cold out.  I will certainly visit again!"
Tina T.,"Fairfax, VA",3/4/2014,4.0,"Wow! Who would've known this quint little tea shop had such great lunch deals.If you come here for lunch, you should definitely check out the $14 dollar tea meal. It comes with 3 side veggies and one main entree dish (chicken curry, miso salmon, and mapo tofu). My colleagues and I all got the salmon with kale, squash and cabbage. The kale was the best tasting veggie out of the choices we got. The way they cook it is different and delicious. Seems so simple but who knows!Miso salmon was wonderfully cooked as well! However, I will admit that I left a little hungry... but overall felt healthy and satisfied! Try their teas to go (it might be a cheaper option and you get to take it with you). Can't wait to go back and take the time to check out their tea options."
Nisht G.,"New Haven, CT",6/19/2014,4.0,"A super cute and no frills Asian gift/tea shop + cafe in the heart of pretentious Georgetown - I approve! My friend and I came on an insanely humid day for a light dinner. We both ordered ice teas (huge glasses for only 2.50) - I ordered apple and she ordered hibiscus. The teas are slightly sweet and insanely refreshing.We also ordered a salmon box, lamb dumplings, and a tea egg to share. While the food isn't amazing (I prefer the food at Teaism), the servings are large and the prices are reasonable.Also, I am obsessed with tea eggs! What a fun way to eat an egg."
Kevin B.,"Fairfax, VA",2/24/2016,4.0,Great selection of teas. The ambience of the place was perfect for a simple and quiet chat. Stayed there for about 30 minutes to kill time until our dinner reservation is ready. Our tea lasted that long. Thumbs up
Kimie K.,"Vienna, VA",2/19/2016,5.0,"Their bento box may not look as compact as other restaurant's ones. BUT the quality of their food surpasses all the other Japanese/or Asian bento boxes I've had so far. Especially their miso sauce salmon is a die-for. I don't know how they make their veggies taste so good but they definitely do the best job in bringing out the healthy flavor.To sum up, just go there. PS. Though I didn't get any of their teas (I'm just not a fan of teas in general so I didn't even try it)"
Justin O.,"Westerville, OH",6/5/2015,5.0,"This tea room alone makes me want to live here!!  Stopped in after touring Georgetown University and am so glad that I did!! The decor and overall ambiance is so authentic! They have traditional floor cushion seating and regular table seating. Sadly the floor seating was taken so I had to sit at a table but it's all good. My legs fall asleep if I sit too long anyway. Haha. We just had tea service, no food, but the food menu looked quite good. My wife and I both got the Monkey King green tea. I can honestly say it was one of the best teas I've ever had. And I've had A LOT of tea in my days. It was served in the traditional Chinese manner and the lady helping is was SO polite! They also have a large selection of packaged teas, tea sets, Pots, cups and books for sale. If you like tea at all and are in the Georgetown area you simply MUST stop in. You will fall in love!"
Ainav W.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/10/2016,5.0,"A great place to relax away from the shopper bustle of Georgetown. Authentic food, delicious drinks-- what more could one ask for?"
Colette M.,"Honolulu, HI",2/17/2014,5.0,Really enjoy this place. I got the ginseng oolong tea and the curry chicken. The meal is filling and the desserts are the best but go here for the experience of having someone teach you how to actually make tea the traditional way.* The curry beef roll and the chicken roll are very flakey and savory. The lotus seed pastry and the coconut tart are me favorite. The coconut tart came out warm and had a very creamy coconut milk flavor. *Just because the nice woman teaches you how to correctly drink oolong tea doesn't make a tea expert.
Gloria S.,"Naples, FL",5/22/2012,3.0,"Beautiful place, I wish I could clear the floor and do yoga here. Not for kids or babies (echos), not for old or fat people who cannot get up after sitting on the floor, not good for big appetites with small pockets (of cash).Come and check out the books, other items, if not eat. Worth a peek in."
Star T.,"Greensboro, NC",7/17/2015,5.0,"The Mongolian dumplings are heavenly. The flavor is great, they are fresh, and the sauce is equally good. I also tried the Harmony tea, it was great, I as able,to get 8 steeps from one serving. Win!"
Hannah C.,"San Diego, CA",3/14/2015,5.0,"Georgetown's hidden emerald! Like the venue (see my photographs), the food and tea is carefully prepared and dripping with flavor. Ching Ching Cha is easily my new favorite restaurant in Georgetown."
Matthew W.,"Alexandria, VA",1/16/2016,5.0,"A very peaceful tea house with a courteous staff, delicious tea selection and good food. I will definitely be returning here."
Qiana G.,"Waldorf, MD",1/17/2016,4.0,"My daughter and I enjoyed a wonderful afternoon here yesterday. We had the tea lunch but we also tried the marble tea egg, Mongolian dumplings, mochi, and pineapple square. Everything was so good! It was our first time here but we will definitely return!"
Cat P.,"Sterling, VA",8/22/2013,4.0,"This is a nice little sanctuary, and a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of Georgetown. The environment is definitely very serene, sedative. When you first enter, it looks like nothing more than a storefront but once you get further in, you'll see an area with low-lying tables where you can sit cross-legged while sipping on one of Ching Ching Cha's many teas. Regular tables are also available, if sitting on the floor isn't your thing.Apparently, they have their own sort of happy hour: eight-dollar tea set (predetermined, whatever they're offering that day) with either four dumplings or coconut custard. Pretty sweet! The tea of the day was qimen, a supposedly dark and fruity tea. Don't know where they get the fruity...Fruity wouldn't be what I would use to describe the taste. It was bitter and not as fragrant as some other teas I've tried, but there was something very nourishing about it, somewhat medicinal, and soothing. It was strange because it put me in a period of strange restfulness before turning me into the Energizer Bunny. Yes, I imagine being under the influence of some substance might have a similar effect...Anyway, it's good to know that I can get the same effect from something perfectly legal and healthy.Tom N said the food was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't bad. I actually liked the thin-skinned dumplings that they offer, filled with veggies. The almond cookies, though pretty, aren't something I'd order again. The coconut custard, on the other hand, was pretty good. It was warm and very buttery, which was surprising for a Chinese dessert.The tea selection is one of the most extensive I've ever seen in this area. You can buy their tea offerings in individual bags if you want.What I appreciated was that they thoroughly explained the nuances of the different teas in their menu as well as the health benefits associated with each type of tea/tea family. I am becoming more and more of a tea fanatic, so I will definitely visit this Zen teahouse again. Furthermore, the service was polite and fast, which added to the relaxing experience."
Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",12/10/2014,5.0,"How I heard of this place: My good friend Stephanie was having a Girls Night: Georgetown Prowl and this was our first stop!Type of cuisine: A Chinese teahouse in Georgetown, established in 1998, serving a plethora of loose-leaf teas and infusions, as well as small bites to share. The word Cha, in Chinese, means tea and Ching Ching is the founder of this tea house.""Ching Ching spends a few months each year visiting different tea regions of China, Taiwan and Japan, searching for the best quality tea and unique tea wares to bring home.We serve over 70 different kinds of tea in a traditional way and offer personal instruction on the best way to prepare the different kinds of tea with corresponding tea ware.To accompany the tea, we also provide a well designed menu that includes tasty tea snacks, delicious homemade steam dumplings, a healthy set of tea meals and traditional Chinese deserts.In addition to tea, we sell a wide range of products from across Asia including an extensive selection of teawares and tea accessories; Asian interest books; fine paper products; handicrafts; and small home furnishings.""Ambiance: ""A lofty tearoom that feels a world away. A tranquil, lovely space made serene with beautiful rosewood tables and chairs, platform seating with fluffy cushions, and walls that disappear into overhead skylights. ching ching CHA is a calming, soothing and authentic setting making this an ideal place to enjoy the classic tea ritual.""What I ordered: Our party of seven started with tea, including: three orders for The Eight Treasure ($8 each), a soothing and mood-enhancing tea prepared with chrysanthemum, honey dates, wolf berry, dried longan, raisins, green tea, red dates and osmanthus; two orders of the Floating Lantern ($7 each) - jasmine buds tied around a bright pink flower (Globe Amaranth, Gomphrena Globosa), classic jasmine bouquet nicely balanced with green tea flavor; three orders of the Ginger+Lime ($8 each) to stimulate circulation, reduce fatigue and ""winds"" in the blood; and one for the Roses Bud ($7), a romantic infusion with the enticing essence of roses. Our party selected a handful of eats to share, including Kale sauteed in sweet soy with ginger and scallions, Green Squash served in a garlic & pepper sauce, and three orders of the Vegetable Dumplings ($5 each) filled with mushrooms, carrot, cabbage, vermicelli & dried bean curd.What I loved: I started with the Ginger+Lime tea and was immediately followed by two others, placing the same order. Around the table the votes were unanimous for the favorite among our evening tea selections. Of the foods, the kale, surprisingly stole the show! It's vibrant color, soft yet crunchy texture and the lightly sweetened flavor of soy sauce to top it off.Why I loved it: A calming, serene and peaceful setting in which to partake of an afternoon tea with a group of amazing women.Cost: High ($6 - $20 per pot of tea)"
Sheryl M.,"Beachwood, OH",6/9/2015,4.0,We had a lovely lunch today. The bento boxes lunch was light and perfect. The service was spot on and the space was very relaxing and peaceful! Wonderful iced hibiscus tea! My salmon was perfectly seasoned as was the tofu. Great spot to relax in Georgetown!
Ariel R.,"Waco, TX",5/14/2016,4.0,Nice tea house with authentic feel and tastes. Really enjoyed the lotus seed pastries.
Danny M.,"Chevy Chase, MD",11/19/2014,4.0,"Although a bit on the pricier side, I really enjoyed this place. It definitely provided an oriental atmosphere that is somewhat more emphasized than many other tea places in the DC area, and that really makes it stand apart.  I also really enjoy the fact that they sell numerous tea accessories along with numerous other things. The waitress was extremely courteous and patient with us, patiently explaining the flavors and strengths of different teas as we could not even pronounce most of what was on the menu.I forgot the exact name of the tea that I had but it was one of their strongest and was it ever strong! I really enjoyed it, although next time I think I will try something a little on the lighter side. What I liked most about this place was the fact that I really did not feel like I was in DC, let alone the US. I felt like I was transported to an oriental tea room in China, with an extremely friendly staff and exotic flavors. Then I received the bill and was reminded that I was indeed in Georgetown..."
Vicky L.,"Arlington, VA",12/14/2013,4.0,"Ching Ching Cha is a little tea shop tucked away in Georgetown. We stopped by for afternoon tea, and almost thought it was closed from the outside! Once we got inside, the atmosphere was incredibly serene. We went in the afternoon so there was natural light only in the shop and it was such a quiet, peaceful atmosphere. I loved that there was an option of sitting on cushions or at tables (we picked the cushions!) The environment/ambiance is quaint and intimate -- a great place to kick back for a little while and catch up with friends.. It's another world outside the busy bustle of DC life.Ching Ching Cha offers a wide selection of authentic Asian teas. I was surprised to see so many on the menu. From green tea to oolong to black, there really is something for everyone (my dad would love this place; he's an oolong tea snob) Although it is a little pricier than your average cup of tea, I think that Ching Ching Cha offers a different experience from other cafes. I ordered the passionfruit  tea from the Scented menu and it smelled amazing. The artisan teas are really pretty as well. I loved that this is a traditional Chinese tea place even down to the way tea is brewed (warming the cup with hot water, cleansing the tea leaves before steeping the tea) This place felt like home to me. The almond cookies were also a perfect compliment to the tea (I love the crunchiness + little bit of sweetness) though I don't know that I would order them again since you can get them almost anywhere.Though it is a little further to travel, if I were ever in Georgetown with friends and looking to sit and chat for awhile, I would definitely come back."
Karlene C.,"NJ, NJ",9/28/2014,5.0,"Georgetown ceases to amaze me. Hidden among the bustling crowds and busy streets, is this tiny gem of a tea shop. My boyfriend, my friend and I were looking for a place to relax after walking all over Georgetown. We found an oasis from the crowds and heat here.All the teas we had were excellent. And the dumplings were amazing.I'm definitely going back and buying some tea next time.No frills, but it's an honest Chinese Tea House."
Ashley Y.,"Alexandria, VA",12/18/2013,5.0,"This place is great! Smack in the middle of Georgetown, you'll find a nice getaway from the hustle bustle and can sit back to enjoy a pot of wonderful Chinese tea.  They had a vast selection of loose teas you can order in a pot.  The prices vary quite a bit, so there's definitely something for every tea lover.  They have a great presentation of the way they serve the tea, depending on how it's best taken. The service was very attentive, filling our teapots with hot water often so we never ran dry!  It's one of the few spots I've been to that has a legit tea selection.  They also have a little shop area where you can pick up some tea accessories, loose tea, books, etc.  If you're in a rush, don't worry! You can still order a cup of hot tea to go, but they have only generic flavors for various types (one oolong, one green, etc.).Definitely would recommend this place for both on the go or to sit down for a stay.  Love this place! Give it a try and you'll love it too!"
Mr B.,"Denver, CO",11/18/2014,5.0,Unbelievably diverse and unusual teas and ceremony options to stay and drink or dine as well - mind blowing!  Selection of jade and porcelain as well as imported books and accessories is unlike anything I've seen stateside!
Roger M.,"Alexandria, VA",8/3/2013,5.0,"Wow ... I can't believe this place is actually HERE.  I've walked by at least a bajillion times and never noticed it.Ching Ching CHA is a GREAT place to spend a pleasant, quiet afternoon ... or an intimate, peaceful evening ... and just to stop in to pick out of a few ounces of your favorite brew to take home with you.  Part tea shop, part shoes-off, comfy-pillowed lounge, and part restaurant, you will definitely enjoy whatever time you spend in this wonderful little gem.I went with a group of friends and everyone enjoyed themselves immensely.  I had the D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S Mongolian dumplings and some intensely great iced tea (it is August, after all ...).  Others in my group had the Tea Meal (think bento-style box lunch only different), and several had different hot teas.  The tea service is really out of this world, and each tea (and tea service) is different.Incidentally, we were a pretty eclectic, varied, and distracted group, but the wait staff's  patience and care with each of us was phenomenal.  They are truly warm, hospitable hosts -- you'll feel like you're in their home.Go to Ching Ching CHA, and let the minutes melt away ... you'll be very happy that you ducked in from the Georgetown bustle!  (NOTE:  This is not a place to dine if you're on a tight schedule or have your kids in tow, but if you've got the time to savour its charms you'll be glad you did.)"
Sunny C.,"Ashburn, VA",8/12/2014,3.0,"It's a cute place to enjoy a nice cup of tea (or more). The tea presentation was lovely as was the selection. My favorite is the Eight Treasures tea (where you can even eat the fruit). The tea meal is bland, so keep that in mind. It's meant to be a healthy and very light meal (technically more of a snack).Service is OK.Where they can improve is (1) we received the wrong order (got one vegetable in our tea meal incorrect) and they never came back with the correct order, (2) the bathroom could use an update (peeling paint), and (3) offer tea to enjoy as a group. Wouldn't sharing tea would make the experience more authentic? :)I would return if I had a special guest in town, but for a $14 tea meal and $9 tea, the price was too steep for me."
Kirk S.,"Washington, DC",9/9/2014,5.0,"The peace and quiet of this little store, in conjunction with its offering of amazing teas, makes it absolutely worth the visit.  I had no idea a place like this could survive/exist in otherwise somewhat crowded/busy Georgetown."
Reza M.,"Manhattan, NY",4/2/2016,5.0,Cozy tea house; perfect for a relaxing cup of really good Chinese tea. one of my must go places when I'm in Georgetown!
Anonymous U.,"Washington, DC",10/10/2015,5.0,"I absolutely love this place. Friendly staff, peaceful environment, fantastic food and a dynamic selection of teas. Plan out your visit strategically, as this area is quite congested. The parking garage across the street is very pricey and street parking is difficult to come by."
Christopher H.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",12/21/2014,4.0,"Good quality. Good service. Authentic serving according to the type of tea. Enjoyed it thoroughly. The food was not my focus, but found it to be tasty."
R B.,"Manhattan, NY",3/2/2016,5.0,"Walked into the shop after a heavy lunch. The jasmine blossom tea is aromatic but not overpowering. The almond cookies were okay, too dry and brittle. Ambiance is that of a tea house. Would recommend for all avid tea lovers"
Carol C.,"San Francisco, CA",7/17/2012,4.0,"This place is so zen. Like: why yes, I will sit on this floor pillow and lounge on these embroidered cushions while food and drink magically appear at face level. And look at these generous skylights pouring in golden sunshine. And how on earth is it so quiet and clean? Toto we can not possibly be in Georgetown anymore.Even if we were to ignore the surroundings, the food itself was enough to make my tastebuds and innards feel like they had just gone on the most spiritual and divine green nirvana yogic organic biodynamic etc etc of juice cleanses. Only instead of liquefied seaweed, I got to enjoy the most delicious kale, zucchini, and cabbage salads and the most sublimely tender miso mustard salmon as part of their 'tea meal'. The portions are sizeable and left me pleasantly satisfied and even feeling a bit healthier, a rare thing when dining out. The curry beef pastry appetizer and mongolian dumplings also offered their own tasty pathways to inner bliss. Ching Ching Cha is the place to go for a peaceful and restorative meal. The name is a little eyebrow-raising, and they stop serving food an hour before they close (or maybe that's just their policy when a crowd of disheveled and decidedly un-zen young folk wander in at 9PM..our bad) but all in all, a really beautiful little place to pretend I have more depth and inner tranquility than I actually possess."
Maya A.,"San Diego, CA",3/8/2014,3.0,"On my most recent trip to DC, I really wanted to visit and explore Georgetown a bit. With the help of Yelp I found this cool little chinese tea shop and thought I'd give it a try.I've never been into a chinese tea shop or really experienced chinese tea. When we arrived I noticed regular seating as well as an area with two tables set low to the ground. We chose the low tables. We were instructed to take off our shoes and we sat on cushions at our little table. Fun! Next up, the menu. First of all.. they have A LOT of tea. Many, many varieties with descriptions that I could hardly understand or differentiate. I chose the floating lantern, which was a green tea with jasmine. Super cool!! It opened up before my eyes and tasted great. For lunch we ordered the chicken dumplings (delicious) and the chicken curry tea meal. Tea meals, by the way, do not come with tea.My final conclusion was this - fun and memorable experience. Truthfully my palette was not able to differentiate this tea from any other, much cheaper tea. And the prices seemed a bit high. But if you're looking for a unique lunch spot, this is it."
Meg H.,"Jacksonville, FL",9/7/2012,4.0,"What a great gem in the bustle of Georgetown!I've never had such a relaxing lunch!My friend and her fiance and myself found ourselves here one Saturday afternoon and had a great experience.I'm kind of embaressed to say none of us tried any teas, but it was a hot day so we were looking to cool down.Came in, sat right down and who I assume to be the owner came and helped us.I ordered a bottle of water ($5, but it was a huge bottle) and the other two had tap water.We looked at the very charming cloth menu, and ordered. All the while some soothing fountains were DJ'in our experience.My friend and I both ordered the same thing.  1 mongolian dumping ( 4 pieces) for $5.00, and 1 Curry beef roll (2 bits) for $5.00.Her fiance ordered the tea meal, with some veggies and the salmon. He loved it. Overall the food was dynamite! Food took longer than I thought it would, BUT it was so worth it, and I didn't notice because i had such good company.Really relaxing place, with great food, and ambiance right in Georgetown."
Carl N.,"Tizimín, Mexico",5/10/2014,4.0,"3.75 stars.I have been here a ton of times.  Sometimes it is my only reason to go to GTown.  It is a quiet little oasis in a busy shopping area, just off of the main stretch.  Generally service is good.  I like to take off my shoes and take the seating with the low tables and pillows, otherwise I do not bother with the normal tables.  This is very relaxing however sometimes the staff seem eager to rush you out, which I do not like.  I have never actually seen a place bring the check out before you ask for it.  Otherwise, it is a solid place if there is not so much foot traffic that they are trying to rush you out as a response to that traffic.  Good tasting tea, good price (considering they will refill your hot water) and flavor of tea lasts longer than you would think.  Never tried the food here.  Like the calm ambiance."
Justina N.,"Munich, Germany",6/4/2015,4.0,I had the vegetable dumplings. It was good but not amazing. The tea was great! It had a great atmosphere and the customer service was great. Will be back again!
Ideen S.,"Alexandria, VA",5/6/2013,5.0,"I am a huge fan of Ching Ching Cha. Very authentic and cozy tea house that's in one of the busiest areas of DC (Georgetown), but never seems to get that busy.When you enter, there are 4 or 5 tables where you can normally. And then two tables that are low to the ground with several pillows (make sure to take your shoes off before you enter this second area). Of course, the pillowed area is way cooler and more comfortable than the tables. But regardless, the service is very good, the tea selection and quality is excellent, and the prices aren't too bad.They also have a pretty solid selection of tea, pots, and other items that you can purchase for home. Quality and prices are again quite good!"
Jane H.,"Centreville, VA",2/26/2013,4.0,"This was my first time in a tea house and I very much enjoyed the experience. The bf and I each had a different type of tea.. one green (melon seed?) and one strawberry-like. Unfortunately I don't remember the names of the tea :( I had the strawberry and it was very aromatic and pleasant. The bf liked his green tea. We also had the curry beef roll which was yummy but pricey for the portion in my opinion. We told the server we had never been there before and he kindly explained the teas and the steps to drinking it properly. The teacups were so cute and unique to each tea, and we had fun brewing the tea over and over again. I also liked all the products they had for sale, like teacup sets and books about tea. There were also books that I thought was a little random (i.e. Korean folk tales for children) but they were fun to browse through. Next time I want to sit on the floor with the cushions :)"
Ben B.,"Arlington, VA",7/13/2013,4.0,It was ok. The tea's a little pricey. Photo of my experience: awesomeveganblog.com/201…
Marissa M.,"Washington, DC",2/17/2014,5.0,"I'm a huge fan. I now purchase my tea exclusively from them.The guy teaches you how to drink the tea you purchase if you drink it in-house. The dumplings are pretty solid; I prefer the ones at Shanghai Lounge. But you don't come to ching ching CHA for the dumplings, you come for the tea and the experience of sitting on the floor if you're lucky enough to get a floor table.They also sell tea accessories, chop sticks, books, and other knick knacks for somewhat reasonable prices. I got two pairs of chopsticks and two cute cat-shaped chopsticks rests for $15, and a Year of the Horse birthday card for my younger brother for $2.This is one of the few places I've found so far in DC that I have on a list of where to take my family when they come visit from Texas."
Tanya G.,"Evans Mills, NY",8/29/2013,4.0,"Call it obsessed, call it Asian nostalgia, hell call it crazy but this is one of those places that once discovered I frequented three times in a week!!  I just couldn't believe the awesome calm serenity after a meal and tea here!!  It started off as a different kinda date night (good drinks without alcohol), followed by dragging my brother to try the place for the experience, followed by us kids dragging mom to get back in touch with her Chinese roots.The food menu is not extensive by any means but what they lack in quantity surpasses my expectations in quality.  I have not been disappointed by a single decision off of their menu but of course I have my favorites ;-)For my tea meal I love their miso salmon which comes with a tomato soup to start and your choice of three of their four vegetables.  Please don't feel obligated to choose three different kinds, if you really love kale then order double or triple servings of kale!!  The mongolian dumplings (with lamb) are in every way of the word and its various synonyms - delicious.  The tea menu offers more variety than the food menu and you really can't go wrong with any of the choices.  Each kind of tea comes out with its own ceremonial tea set complete with instructions to wash the tea and how long to steep it.  Some may comment that the teas are a little expensive ranging from $8 - 15.  And maybe I agree with you BUT I argue that you will get quality tea unobtainable elsewhere, it's refillable to the capacity of the tea leaves which will be plenty and all of that is far cheaper than any drink options at other restaurants.  Try getting a refillable quality cocktail for $15, surely you won't feel as great that night or the morning after ;-)I kid you not I can and have spent hours here with a good book.  The natural lighting, the quiet atmosphere, the decadent tea.  Sometimes that's all I need as a break from the constant trend mill that is life in our nation's capital."
Elisa M.,"Miami Beach, FL",1/13/2014,5.0,"My first time trying a tea marbled egg, it was surprisingly delicious. It tasted sweet. The curry chicken and veggies were very filling and a nice experience."
Mary C.,"Chino Hills, CA",3/23/2014,4.0,"This is so far the best chinese foods i get, especially their homemade dumplings. Their foods have the simple and clean flavor. However, if you're not really into chinese tea, just skip this since it's a little pricy."
Ron H.,"Manhattan, NY",11/11/2013,4.0,"Great place to get some real Chinese tea. They have good tea eggs, too."
Semra E.,"Washington, DC",1/8/2014,5.0,"Feeling sick, with the flu or just unbalanced in general? Buy some loose tea here & let their staff help you make the right choices. When I walked in I was immediately drawn towards the high ceilings, the peacefulness, antique style wood tables and floor seating.  It really does make you feel like you've stepped out of the USA and I love it all for that. I've heard great things regarding their food, but I also remember coming here for tea when meeting up with a friend which was fantastic.  There's something really special about this place.  I now know where I will be buying all of my tea since they have specialty blends that you just can't find anywhere.  If you're looking for peace, I'm 100% sure that you can find it here."
Sarah L.,"Falls Church, VA",7/2/2011,4.0,"""Cha"" is the Chinese word for tea, and ""Ching Ching"" is the owner of this serene tea house!I have been to Ching Ching Cha a few times. This is a quiet getaway in the heart of Georgetown. The decor is what I would call ""Chinese apothecary""--dark wooden furniture, with traditional Chinese motifs. It looks like a small place from the outside, but it's quite spacious inside, with natural lighting and high ceilings. They have low tables (where you're sitting on the ground) that can seat up to four people, or if you prefer sitting at a regular table, they have those, too. There is a burner at each table and when they bring your tea, they set the kettle on top of it so it remains warm during your visit. In the middle of the tea room they display a variety of tea ware and accessories.They have a limited food menu, but the true beauty of this place is the tea. They offer nearly 70 varieties, hot and cold, with an emphasis on Chinese tea. The staff is very knowledgeable and will instruct you on how to properly prepare and enjoy the tea you order.I have had a few items from the food menu and here are my opinions on them:* Mongolian Dumpling: Set of 4, with lamb, cabbage, and garlic. A good starter to your meal.* Chicken Roll: Chicken prepared in a flaky puff pastry. Good, but something I can easily make at home, so I will not reorder it.* Bento Box Lunch: You start off with the tomato soup, which was delicate and delicious. It's a light broth with bits of tomato, swirled with soft silken tofu, and garnished with parsley and sesame seed oil. For the bento, you pick a main entree, and two vegetables. I selected mustard miso salmon and kale and Korean squash. I felt there was too much mustard on my salmon; other than that, it was pretty good. On my last visit, I tried the chicken curry, and while I make a mean Japanese curry rice, this wasn't too bad. They use white meat and still manage to make it fork tender. I think I'll stick with the salmon next time. For my veggies, I picked the kale, squash, and snowpeas.Ching Ching Cha serves light fare, however. I do not recommend coming here if you are famished, as you will easily spend $20+ per person. They do accept credit cards, but I am not sure if there is a minimum order, as I have always spent more than $20 here.Albeit on the expensive side, bear in mind that you are paying for the experience and ambiance. Don't come here if you only have 30 minutes to spare for lunch, as the staff can be slow to prepare food. Come here on a lazy Sunday afternoon and forget about deadlines, errands, and feel the stress just melt away!"
Joanna C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/9/2012,5.0,"Stepping off the streets of Georgetown after a day of shopping, I happily take in the ambiance of Ching Ching Cha. From the oriental music to the Asian tea items to the high ceiling and zen ambiance, this adorable little tea cafe instantly relaxes me.My friend and I start off sitting at a table, but we're really holding out for one of the two floor tables with all of the pillows. Luckily for us, after five minutes, the people at the table leave and it's all ours! I order the vegetable dumplings and rose bud tea. The dumplings are delicious! They're very light and laid perfectly across the plate. The rosebud tea is also beautiful. I love how there's the stone (not quite sure what it's made of of) pot boiling in the middle of the table, my little, clear glass tea pot with the rose buds and then my teacup. The rosebuds open up when you pour hot water on them and the tea is delicious. Although there's a lot of people in the cafe, it's peaceful and a great spot for private conversation and tranquil reflection.It might seem unzen to pay around $10 for a cup of tea, but it's a really good cup of tea and the rosebuds make several good cups of tea at that, and the ambiance is definitely worth it. I've yet to find a tea cafe even close to as wonderful as this one (even in China, where believe or not, the tea cafes are much more expensive and it's noisier). Definitely check this place out!"
Cathy B.,"Hyattsville, MD",10/6/2013,5.0,"As a tea lover (who does not at all like coffee)......I was thrilled to see a place dedicated to tea. After all, coffee generally gets all the attention and I cannot even stand the smell of coffee.Twice I've gotten tea from this quaint shop and both times I was quite pleased.  On my last visit, I got some grapefruit tea (iced) and it was beyond delicious.  In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I make it regularly at home now.Several have indicated that the prices here are steep.  I don't see it that way.  Consider the rent for Georgetown....and the taxes and insurance.....then consider that people have to pay employees and make a profit.  When you look at the expenses, you will not view the prices as steep.  I'd rather pay a little more for good quality tea than see these people shut down as so many others have.Check them out.  I believe you will be pleased"
Leslie T.,"Arlington, VA",4/18/2012,3.0,"Ching Ching Cha is a great place to bring guests to for a different kind of experience or to just relax after a long day of shopping.  The service is a little slow and the food offerings are a bit limited, but the tea selection is amazing and delicious.I rated only three stars even though I will go back because parking is difficult unless you park in the Georgetown Park Garage, you need to allow at least a couple of hours because the service is pleasant but slow, and if you are hungry, you only have a few options."
Janet K.,"Boston, MA",8/19/2014,5.0,Great food. Yummy teas. Great service. Great atmosphere. Great experience. Thank you for the experience ching ching cha! Has the mustard miso salmon. Mongolian dumplings. Mochi. The salmon came in a bento box like form. All was delicious and light. Will come back again
Carla V.,"Penn Quarter, Washington, DC",8/30/2013,5.0,Nice place; great variety of teas!Good staff!
R P.,"Washington, DC",12/20/2014,5.0,"This place is a little oasis amongst all the havoc in Georgetown. The Kale is so good, I always order it when I visit."
Kirsten L.,"Kendall, FL",4/12/2013,5.0,"We were looking for a bathroom and stumbled upon this place. What a cool place to check out! It looked small on the outside, but pretty big in the inside. We sat/kneeled on a table with pillows. The atmosphere was really nice. Our waiter 1st day on the job was pleasant. If he didn't know the answer to our questions then someone else would come over to answer it. They sell tons of tea, tea pots, cups etc. I bought a $15 single serve tea cup. I've always wanted one. We ordered iced tea- grapefruit, apple, and, hibiscus. All were good. Another ordered a ""smoky"" tea and it really tasted smoky. He described it as the burnt part of the BBQ. We also ordered the almond cookies ($2/2!!!!!!!) and a lotus cookie ($6/4!!!!!!!!!!!!- or something like that). All were good but over priced. Overall great experience. $70 later we walked out happy."
Krys P.,"Miami, FL",11/19/2011,4.0,"It should be mandatory that every city has a little haven like this, where people can retreat to, be transported to another world and time, and enjoy some tranquility and Zen moments.  On the other hand, this place is so quiet, I wonder how it survives unless it does a real blooming business selling tea online or elsewhere.  I love the decoration, very authentic Chinese.  Cute clothbound menu.  Tin jars line the wall with the names of tea in brush calligraphy.  A beautiful selection of clay teapots and other tea paraphilia, including tea magazines. (I never knew one exists...)A good selection of tea.  I ordered the blooming tea and it was fun watching the ugly ball uncurled into beautiful flowers, almost magical, and totally mesmerizing.  The food menu, on the other hand, is seriously limited and overpriced for the size of portion.  I don't think they have a full kitchen, and it feels like things are pre-made, then reheated to order."
Marty L.,"Madison, CT",10/1/2014,3.0,"I feel mixed. The tea here is very good. However, the lunch bento box was absolutely terrible. That curry is a packaged cube (bouillon) type that is pretty cheap and the rice was so-so. That's not jasmine rice. The three vegetable options are just chopped up raw veggies with soy-type sauce sprinkled on top. It's like what I would eat for weekend lunch at home when I'm too lazy to fix something but craving Asian food...the squash wasn't even washed properly so was covered with grit.  Too bad. Nice atmosphere and quiet. Pretty jars of tea boxes and jars.  But that lunch bento has to come off the menu."
Benjamin O.,"Washington, DC",8/24/2015,4.0,Really cool place if your interested in tea. They have wide variations of teas you can try. I would recommend the passionfruit and the strawberry green.
Amolrada T.,"Glover Park, Washington, DC",10/23/2014,5.0,"Nice and do close to authentic Chinese tea house. The price isnt so bad either considering the location. They have a good range of teas and a heck load of tea related merch that are just adorable. The food is nice, but don't expect a restaurant type of food. After all, it is a tea house. The staff (2-3) people are diligent refilling the kettle and are sweet with the Asian standard of service (always smiling, thanking and apologizing) and this comes from an Asian person. Love this place:)"
Simone M.,"Annapolis Junction, MD",9/27/2015,4.0,Saved the day! We ducked in to get out of the rain. Tea was a bit pricey but enjoyable. Service was passable (it was late & I think they were ready to go home...completely understandable) The tea was excellent! Would definitely return ... earlier in the day of course ;-)
Leah N.,"Manhattan, NY",6/6/2014,5.0,"crossposting part of my tripadvisor review...Totally positive experience. Highly recommended for hanging out over tea and light snacks anytime, or for tea + lunch -- either on one's own or with a friend or so.The room's pleasingly square and lofty proportions are echoed by broad square wooden chairs, and tables both low and high. A lovely shallow cupola's worth of skylights illuminates the intimate and casual space. Decor balances dark and light hues -- the spacing of furniture is generous -- and the room boasts excellent, conversation-inducing acoustics. It all seems just right for a real Chinese tea room. We came for lunch on a beautiful weekday recently. We shared food, and each of us had her own different type of tea and design of tea set. I attempted, with the staff's instruction, to improve my olfactory awareness. This involved splashing about with tiny pot, pourer and cup over a little wooden draining rack set into a shallow wooden reservoir box. If this micro-universe was sometimes messy, that was no problem either socially or aesthetically. This wasn't a formal Japanese tea ceremony. Splashing was OK, and beautifully contained. The foodstuffs we tried were excellent. The Mongolian dumplings gorgeously wrapped and their flavor intense. Delicious. The tea eggs as yummy as any I've tried. Peanut salad clean and crunchy, complementing soft/hot foodstuffs. Desserts elegant and flavorful with varied textures and temperatures. The presentation overall easy and charming. The staff helpful. It was tempting to shop here for tea and tea wares after we ate/drank. There was a wide range of price points, with some especially tempting items at the higher end."
Elana B.,"WSHNGTN XING, PA",3/29/2013,3.0,"Ironically I didn't actually have any tea here.This review is for ""the tea meal"" (which for the record...does NOT come with tea) for $14 you get a bento style box with rice and: 1 ""tomato soup""3 Vegetables (of your choice)1 Entree (of your choice) Lets start with the tomato soup:This soup was really more like a clear egg drop soup with some bits of tomato in it. It was average-ly tasty. Nothing remarkable. 3 Veggies: I chose the kale, the cabbage and the snow peas (as recommended by the hostess)Kale was my favorite, it was a nice raw kale with a slightly sweet/salty light dressing on it. Liked it a lot!The cabbage had the same dressing as the kale on it. Served crunchy and raw. Very tasty, Second favorite.My least favorite (although still good) were the snow peas. They also were raw, but just tasted like they were in a light soy sauce. Not too impressive.Entree:As a vegetarian I had the Silken tofu in homemade mapao sauce. Hmm...hard to judge this one.  First let me start by saying that the tofu itself is wonderful. It's soft and creamy and squishy.  But then they cover it in this mapao sauce. Do you know what mapao is? I didn't! It's a fermented black bean sauce. It's quite salty. I had never tasted fermented black beans before. They have a strange flavor. After a bit of deliberation I decided I liked it. Loved it? No. But liked it enough to put the rest of the sauce on the rice once the tofu was gone. It was VERY tasty on rice. I guess it dilutes it a little?  Also it was served with a tiny bit of some tasty pickled carrots. LOVED them! So good. Sweet and vinegar-y. Anyway I polished off my box. Wasn't wowed by anything, but enjoyed everything. Afterwords I ordered dessert.For $6 I ordered the lotus seed in puff pastry. WE FOUND A WINNER! 4 little square cakes came out HOT (not warm, hot!) Oh my goodness let me tell you about dense nutty, sweet lotus root paste sandwiched between the butteriest, flakiest pastry dough i've ever tasted. I ate all 4 of theme myself (you can judge me after you go taste them...) Overall $20 for 3 courses isn't bad especially for Georgetown. I wish they charged less for the vegetarian option, but it was exactly the same price as the salmon entree!  And nearly all the teas there are about $10 and up..and up! So it can get quite pricy quite fast. REASONS TO GO:ATMOSPHERE! It's tres Zen. They have an area where you take your shoes off and sit on cushions on the floor next to a gold buddha statue (thats where I sat). Quite fun. Felt so exotic.TEA SELECTION! They have everything. I would have loved to try their 20 year old Pu'erh tea. LOTUS CAKES! Just order these and skip the $14 tea meal. The cakes were outstanding. The meal was just good. Dining recommendation: Skip the ""tea meal"". Order a fancy tea. Order some tea snacks. (I've heard their dumplings are quite good)."
Isabelle K.,"Philadelphia, PA",3/4/2013,4.0,"Stumbled in here on a trip to DC a few months ago. It caught our eye right away since tea houses are few and far between in Philly. This tea house and shop is almost like a museum of tea. After browsing the shelves, we decided not to sit down for tea, though the food  and tea looked fantastic, and opted to order some tea to go. We got about one block down the street until the tea was cool enough to sip, and one sip was all it took. Ofter polishing of half of my boyfriend's cup of strong, velvety green tea with a powerful punch of flavor, I headed right back in to ching ching CHA and ordered myself a cup. I'd love to find a place that served tea this good in Philly. I'd gladly hand over my daily coffee over for a cup of that tea! It'll definitely be a destination every time we're in DC from now on!"
Lena P.,"Washington, DC",11/11/2012,3.0,"I ordered the grapefruit iced tea, mongolian dumplings, and chicken puff pastry roll.  It was all definitely delicious, although I was deterred from ordering an actual meal because of the high prices.  The ambiance was nice and quaint- you have the option of sitting on a normal table or on the ground Japanese-style, and they played some traditional chinese music in the background.  I'll probably come back for one of their teas-to-go because the iced tea was particularly thirst-quenching but I wouldn't recommend this place if you are looking for a solid, inexpensive meal to go along with the tea."
Elliott 1.,"Chantilly, VA",11/16/2014,5.0,"This is so far the best chinese foods i get,I'm definitely going back"
Han F.,"Boston, MA",6/27/2014,3.0,"It's nice that this exists in George Town. I like getting the iced teas to go. They actually use a good quality jasmine green tea. I wasn't a fan of the hibiscus tea when I dined in. It was more fruit juice like then tea. I should have asked if it was hibiscus flowers in black tea (what I thought I was ordering) versus just plain hibiscus brewed in water. I got a salmon rice box which was filling and not bad for $14. It's obviously a small eatery and doesn't offer much in terms of food. I would not come for lunch, but I would come for tea. I've tried the Mongolian dumplings as well, and I didn't like the lamb taste, but they were more for Theo, who loves lamb, and loved the dumplings."
Nicole D.,"Howell, NJ",6/8/2014,5.0,"Super cute, I had an iced hibiscus tea to go but I'd love to come back and eat. They have pillows on the floor for traditional afternoon tea."
James F.,"Amawalk, NY",9/29/2014,4.0,"all their flavored ice teas are wonderful, and their dumplings, small and few, are delicious that you should make sure to order more then one when you sit. the decor is old school and it works great. I could put bunker down here with my laptop on a cloudy day."
Rob N.,"Washington, DC",8/19/2014,2.0,"I wish I could give this place a better review, the two stars is for the tea not the service. My friend and I came to the shop on a very hot and humid day. We came up to the counter and ordered and without asking the man serving us put our tea in to go cups, which was fine with us in case we wanted to take some of it out of the restaurant. We walked over to one of the many open tables to sit and this is where the problem arose. After we had sat down the same man who had gotten us our tea came over to us and we were told that we either had to order tea ""for here"" which as $4.50 or we had to leave immediately. I was very surprised by this as I had just ordered from him and given him my business but due to the fact that he stood by our table until one or the other happened, we decided to leave. ."
Joanne S.,"Manhattan, NY",2/14/2015,3.0,"Tea....awesome. Service....awesome. Food...don't go there, now salmon and veggies were bland, curry chicken had zero zip."
Hannah C.,"Washington, DC",10/6/2009,4.0,"The short of it:  This is a serene retreat within the hustle bustle of busy Georgetown.The long of it: As you walk in, you walk past large gorgeous pieces of Chinese furniture covered by a vast array of tea pots, gift sets,  and paraphernalia for sale.  The dark entrance hall opens into a bright tea room with a two story atrium topped by a small skylight that illuminates the entire room even on cloudy days.  To your left, a central wooden buddha overlooks two low traditional tables surrounded by pillows on the floor.  If you sit here, you'll be asked to remove your shoes.  Otherwise, you can sit at any of the other tables with chairs to the right.There is a very good ""tea meal"" lunch box offering with yummy salmon with mustard sauce, rice, and veggies.  The dumplings are good.But you came here for the tea... which is served as ceremoniously as we uneducated masses can handle... with specific brewing and cup selections tailored to the kind of tea that you've ordered.  The blossom teas are the ones that entertain me the most.  I sit quietly in front of the glass pot watching the blossom as it slowly expands before me.  Beautiful.Each tea here is the highest in quality, sought out and hand picked by the owner, who travels regularly to China to restock her supplies.Tea is an art.  At Ching Ching Cha, that art is introduced to the masses  in a completely stress-free environment by graceful servers.After your meal (or just tea), look around at the exquisite selection of tea cups, strainers, and leaf teas available for purchase.Tip: It gets busy here during the weekend lunch rush... patience is key."
Sally G.,"Manhattan, NY",6/28/2014,5.0,"Best find in DC, hands down. Run by Mainland Chinese, legit tea equipment, very welcome staff. Would definitely make this a regular spot for hosting guests!"
Kevin T.,"San Francisco, CA",8/28/2012,4.0,"*authentic chinese tea to sooth your soul*#floorpillowseating#knowledgeablehostess So me and a friend stumbled upon this place while waiting for Filomena's next door. We decided to grab some tea and an appetizer and incredibly surprised by the place. A shop that sells all kinds of tea goodies, tea sets, teas, and tea books. On top of that, a cozy little cafe who's hostess was incredibly knowledgeable of the types of teas, the ritual to pour, and what looked like good food (spying on other people's food). If you're a tea drinker, definitely come check out this place. Has a lot of character and great place to stock up on tea goodies."
Ann T.,"Fairfax, VA",7/25/2011,4.0,"Very unique in terms of experience as well as food and teas. The shop is nice, with high ceilings. There is a sense of tranquility when you enter. Came with some friends on a Saturday afternoon. Located in G-town, Saturday probably wasn't the best day to come, seeming as we all had some difficulty finding parking. Barebones in terms of fare offering. They have appetizers which are around $6 and very small (think Dim Sum portions) and entrees which come in a cute bento box, but there isn't much in em, especially for the price. Teas are their specialty. Note: some hot teas, i.e. the flower teas, are more for show rather than flavor, as they blossom in the hot water.Bathrooms are cute and well kept. Single person stalls with one for men and another for women. Note - the lightswitch is outside of the bathrooms, to your left if you're a woman and to your right if you're a man when you're facing the door, about to enter."
Austin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/16/2014,4.0,"Great place for tea, losses a point for atmosphere simply because the shop has a couple rows of merchandise right next to the dining area. They do have a good selection of cool tea pots, trinkets, chopsticks, teacups, etc. Again, GREAT TEA. And really that's exactly why people come. If you're lucky you can get one of the few low tables and kick off your shoes for an intimate tea experience with friends."
Theresa W.,"Washington, DC",8/26/2009,4.0,"Lovely, quiet and peaceful.  I was surprised when I came to see that the furniture and atmosphere were really close to a real old fashioned Chinese tea house.  They have an excellent variety of teas ranging from delicate white teas to more robust and astringent black teas as well as floral, fruity, and herbal ones.  It's hard to pick just one to try.  If you want to take some tea home with you, they have lots of bagged ones by the door plus tea paraphernalia. The service was unobtrusive and very polite.  Although the teas are expensive, the leaves allow for multiple steepings so you'll be able to enjoy several cups.  The food was light and inexpensive, and I loved that they had tea eggs, a homemade treat that you rarely see in restaurants."
L.N. C.,"Jacksonville, FL",3/26/2015,5.0,"Great for tea aficionados or novices. I had heard great things about it, but this was a 1st time visit. My teenage son liked his iced apple/green tea and I thoroughly enjoyed my floating lantern. The last time I experienced good Chinese tea was in China so I was looking forward to this. We had eaten lunch earlier so we just had mochi and tea egg as accompaniments, but they were tasty and well-done. Service was friendly,  and she refreshed our hot water kettle without us having to ask. Adorable hand sewn menu covers. This is an ""other world"" escape/experience. For me, the highlight was the tea as well as the atmosphere.  We chose floor seating, and looking around, small things like the worn varnish on the tables and the cozy serenity of the shop and restaurant add to the experience. If I still lived in the area, I would be a regular, no doubt. My only regret is we were too full to order more extensively from the menu. I am already looking forward to another visit. I hope they stay open forever."
Wanting M.,"Washington, DC",6/27/2012,5.0,"Haven't had a sit-down experience yet, but I am in love with their Teas-To-Go! I'm not sure if they do it everyday, but every time I passed by so far, they have had different flavors of iced tea for $2.50 that you can just grab and go! My favorite is the iced rose tea so far... Can't wait to try all the flavors! Perfect thirst quencher on a hot summer day :)"
Ahaviah G.,"Washington, DC",7/11/2012,4.0,"This lovely spot would be a calming influence even if it didn't serve as an escape from the Georgetown crowds but, as it does, it's almost magical.  It's fine to come just for the tea (many kinds, all brewed to perfection), but you'd be missing out. The dumplings are lovely, the beef curry roll is flakey dough filled with a mild but flavorful mix, and the almond cookies are a perfectly balanced treat to finish things off."
Gavin S.,"New York, NY",2/14/2015,5.0,"I'm a big fan of this little spot. I never come to Georgetown without stopping by. There's a cozy/quiet restaurant in there, but I come for the selection of tea. I love their tea! Spicy tea, flower tea, pumpkin tea... there's a whole wall of out-of-the-ordinary tea for the curious. There's also a small area with all your necessary tea gear. If you want to perhaps eat and hear your partner speak, this would be a good place to grab food as well. The prices aren't very Georgetown either! I never felt like I paid a zipcode mark-up. The staff is always friendly and eager to help."
Isabel P.,"Houston, TX",3/18/2010,5.0,"Im so glad a local told me about this place.I guess i looked like a tourist while venturing the streets of DC. I was told to really try this place and that it is quite enjoyable and has a great lunch menu. I am very glad we did. If you are a TEA fanatic, this is the place for you. The prices of the teas are fairly priced. This is a store and resturant in one. Small but intimate. Very authetic feel and great service.Previous reviews are well spoken. I just wanted to say I really enjyoed the place. I will continue to purchase tea from this location and visit again when I am in the area.Must See and Must dinE!!!"
Christine K.,"Oakland, CA",1/3/2014,4.0,"Great service, delicious food that is fresh and not greasy, and of course, good tea. After experiencing terrible service at other places in the vicinity (typical of Georgetown, I suppose), I found Ching Ching Cha to be welcoming and delicious. The tea meal tasted clean, light but filling, and perfectly seasoned (though the miso on the salmon was a bit on the heavy side) - I had the kale, snow peas, squash, and salmon. My friend tried the Yunnan black tea and I had one of the Chinese green teas - both were tasty and beautifully presented. It was a relaxing meal and not once did I feel rushed. They also sell lots of teas and tea wares."
Bryanne S.,"Kailua, HI",3/6/2012,5.0,"I just love this tiny tea house and restaurant. The tea menu offers insight to how the different teas can treat different ailments. One gets the sense they are in an ancient medicinal tea house in China. There is a small menu available with delicate, fresh Chinese meals and snacks that are also beneficial for your health. I had the AMAZING miso-mustard steamed salmon with a variety of steamed veggies. This is such a unique and special place, if you are in the Adams Morgan area, stop by and give it a try. You will be transported!"
Dave S.,"San Jose, CA",8/2/2009,4.0,"I've been here a few times and always enjoy the experience. On my most recent visit, I ordered a blooming tea and some dumplings. Tea is meant to be enjoyed this way, as opposed to swilling it from a big gulp cup and I especially like the wait as my glass pot is placed on the table and the pearl inside blooms open into a large flower. Turn off your mobile when you go in here...not because they ask you to, but simply because you're missing out on the experience of relaxation and the joy of good tea if you remain connected to the spastic world waiting outside."
Megan E.,"Arlington, VA",2/2/2015,4.0,"This place is tucked away into an alley, but it's a great spot to have a chat with friends and get a tasty bite and a nice cup of tea. They have a wide selection of teas, and wares. Their tea is a bit on the pricey side, which I believe is fairly justified due to the location, display and quality of their teas. Their wares are also fairly expensive, but a lot of the things are imports from Japan and other countries which most likely adds to the price. The staff is also very friendly, and the restaurant is quite clean. I suppose the food items are a bit small compared to their price tag, but they are quite delicious. If I ever get a chance to splurge I'd love to get one of their boxes. Great place for tea lovers & for people who want to relax!"
Miami Rice L.,"Miami, FL",5/18/2011,4.0,"Perfect! (If not for red crawling things)We were lucky enough to have stumbled upon this tea house by accident. The shop was beautifully decorated and its atmosphere serene. It felt like we had stepped into a time capsule.Looking for a place to eat while standing RIGHT IN FRONT of Ching Ching Cha, my husband looked them up and announced that they had food, so we went for it. Walking through the narrow hallway with random for-sale Asian furniture pieces along the side, I wondered if we were in the right place. Then the space opened up into a large seating area with wonderful arrangements of tea and accessories. The menu was simple. Husband ordered ginger tea, and I went for the ginseng. We had the tea meal with curry chicken, which was fantastic. Rice was perfectly cooked. Chicken fantastically spiced and melted in my mouth. We also tried a couple of different rolls, which were also tasty.Now, it pains me to deduct a whole star from this wonderful experience, but we weren't crazy about the clover mites. I don't know if this is common and acceptable in the area since no one else seemed bothered by them. We had never seen these red creatures before, and they were EVERYWHERE. From the moment we sat down, they were crawling on the table, on our bodies, etc. We asked the man (owner?) and he told us what they were and assured us that they were harmless little creatures that appeared every spring, so we relaxed some. Still, there were quite many of them (in our clover mites virgin eyes, anyway.) While eating, one or 2 ended up crawling on our food. This added to my paranoia about how many cooked ones we might actually be eating and how many were making their ways into our ear canals right at that very moment.It subtracted from the experience some, but we still enjoyed the place. There are several people I can think of off the top of my head that would get really freaked out by a meal with crawling insects.So we really enjoyed this tea house and would love to go back, but maybe not in springtime."
Serena B.,"Falls Church, VA",1/9/2012,4.0,"Though it was a busy Saturday in Georgetown, we were able to obtain a table without much of a wait. There are two low to the ground tables where you can sit on comfortable cushions and there are about 8 other ""regular"" tables available.We had a great experience with our teas (I ordered the gold needle black tea and my friend ordered the orchid oolong) and we received a demonstration of how to properly serve yourself the teas (the oolong was a little crazy with a teeny tiny teapot and a process of two other containers before your serving cup!). We also both had the ""tea meal"" where you get soup, three vegetables, rice and a featured dish. Tomato soup is a little misleading for what actually was an egg drop soup with little tomato pieces and tofu. The curry chicken was ok, but not amazing. The kale was delicious and the green squash was also good, but I didn't care for the cabbage. I will probably try the dumplings next time because they looked good, but I was way too hungry on this visit!"
Susie W.,"Silverthorne, CO",3/17/2011,5.0,"I've walked by it 100 times, probably more, and have always thought, ""I need to stop in sometime and see what tea accessories I can acquire for my tea aficionado brother!"" Never did it.Then a colleague invited a couple of us to lunch and damn it, if this isn't the most lovely, serene place in Georgetown! The food is simple, straight forward and healthy; the tea is beautiful and potent or mild depending on the path you choose. I now aspire to work this in to a morning routine once a week to sip tea and read a book and embrace a flight of fancy for an hour a week. Simply delish. The food is reasonably priced ($5 for 4 delicious dumplings and $12 for soup, 3 steamed veggies and a protein) and the tea accessories are pricy - and authentic and gorgeous. Definitely go. Great for catching up, long tea sessions or sitting alone in the beautiful interior light."
Kat S.,"Washington D.C., DC",12/7/2011,4.0,"Delightful Chinese tea house and shop. Tucked away at the the bottom of Wisconsin Ave and practically on the C&O Canal, Ching Ching Cha looks small and unassuming from the outside. The teahouse is actually quite spacious inside and bears the bones of a lovely old building - high ceiling, dark wood beams and a skylight. Décor is simple with traditional Chinese touches. It is a welcome respite from the endlessly crowded streets of Georgetown. Along the entry wall and in the middle of the shop are tea wares and accessories for sale, while the rest of the space is reserved for dining - both low seating and standard.I have always loved tea and having lived in China for some time, I felt nearly ebullient falling upon this place. They have a fantastic and lengthy tea selection from oolong and breakfast teas to medicinal and artisan. There is a burner and kettle at each table to keep the hot water flowing. Teas are served in the traditional Chinese manner while the artisan teas bloom beautifully in glasses of hot water. This is not inexpensive, with tea ranging from $6-20, but it is a lovely treat. Everything else just seems like an accessory to the tea. Light fare is served. Mongolian Dumplings ($5) were a good snack. A light Bento style lunch is also available for $14 - 3 vegetables, a soup dish and a main course. Service was friendly and knowledgeable throughout, although I got the sense that lounging around and reading with tea for some time on a Saturday is not exactly encouraged. The tea wares and accessories sold were on the pricey side but beautiful and once again, a lovely treat. In an added and adorable offering, there is something of a tea happy hour on weekdays where for $8 you receive the tea of the day and a savory or sweet treat."
Nancy C.,"Houston, TX",4/30/2011,4.0,"The teas, pots, trinkets they sell surround the seating for this restaurant. It's quiet in here or serene would be a better word, a relaxing escape to have a healthy tea meal or drink. The hibiscus iced drink is not your typical refreshing cool down, it somehow hydrates you without the need for sweetener. I chose the curry chicken for lack of choice (there are 3, one is vegetarian) as I don't like curry. However, I am converted. Why am I so turned off by curry when it can be this good? The broth was full of spices and yet not thick at all. The chunks of chicken were perfectly tender. Oh and the rice. Aromatic grainy rice that I can just eat plain. The choice of 3 vegetables is a no-brainer, they know what they're doing back there. I really like this place."
Travis B.,"Alexandria, VA",3/3/2010,5.0,"The best tea service in DC. I am convinced of it. There are five to ten varieties of each type of tea (white, green, oolong, black, pu-erh, artisan, and scented), and each is served with a setup designed for that kind of tea - a gaiwan for whites and greens, gongfu for oolong, clear glass pot for the artisan teas, etc. There are large teapots kept over a small flame at each table and the brewing is done by the customer, and the tea is meant to be brewed many times. If you are unfamiliar with the equipment or the process for brewing your specific kind of tea, the entirely Chinese staff will show you how to do it. Gaiwans, for example, can be tricky to work with at first. The decor is warm, with dark wood chairs and tables inlaid with decoration, large mirrors and a skylight to let in natural light. Large silver urns of tea line one wall, while tea and tea paraphernalia line another. There are also 2 low sitting tables on a raised platform so you can lounge with pillows while you drink tea and enjoy some peace within Georgetown... Ching Ching Cha is also a great lunch spot, especially for a sunday brunch. Their bento boxes are reasonable ($12), and have delicious miso salmon or curry chicken in them, along with several vegetables and rice. Bring cash if you only want tea - there is a $15 minimum credit card purchase which is easy to hit if you are eating."
A C.,"Washington, DC",12/28/2014,5.0,"Love this place, their tea selection is Fantastic, the staff is very helpful and nice, and the decor takes me back to vacations in China."
James O.,"Gainesville, FL",7/20/2011,5.0,"An eclectic taste in teas, can be pricey, but is always a reward to treat one's self. Sourcing teas from well known sources, ching ching chas commitment to quality is un matched. Light lunch served as well."
Meg R.,"Arlington, VA",11/11/2014,5.0,This has been an absolutely favorite place of mine for 10 years. I always get two marble tea eggs along with whatever scrumptious tea I decide for the day.  Please go when you can sit and enjoy the time.  It's a must do when feeling a little anxious. :)
Karn A.,"Arlington, VA",9/18/2013,5.0,"The more i go here, the better it is. i cannot believe that i have been introduced to this simple quaint yet excellent place in DC. i love going here with my dearest friend for some tea and dumplings. sometimes we get a meal or a desert too. though they specialize in teas, everything is fantastic. they have a wide variety of teas and every one of them is different. one can make out the difference.i would recommend anyone who wants to have simple quiet, private time with someone special should visit this place and enjoy being in China."
Anne L.,"Washington, DC",1/5/2013,4.0,"Refuge from hectic DC and truly fine tea.  This little gem of a tea house feels like a best kept secret.  The tea service is different from what most of us have experienced, but fun and the perfect accompaniment to relaxed conversation.  Be sure to check out the selection of teas, because they have many you will not find anyplace else in DC."
Tsippi S.,"Chicago, IL",6/3/2012,4.0,"Pluses:  Very quiet, relaxed setting.  Tables and chairs were comfortable.  (We also had the option of sitting at one of the tables that required sitting on the floor, but most of the tables were standard height with chairs, which we appreciated.)  We arrived on a Saturday night at about 7:00 and were seated right away.  The food, Chinese-style bento boxes with a light soup, three pickled vegetables, some rice, and either salmon, tofu, or curried chicken, was good.  Fourteen dollars for a bento box in Georgetown seemed acceptable.Minuses:  The tea is VERY expensive.  We just couldn't bring ourselves to spend $10-16 for tea for two, so we stuck with water.  The bento boxes were fine for light eaters, but heartier souls would need to order several appetizers.Overall:  We wanted  quiet place where we could talk, and that's hard to find in Georgetown unless you're going to spend big $$.  This is a great find.  Thanks, Yelp!"
Yelper O.,"Fairfax, VA",5/8/2013,5.0,"What an adorable place.  It's calming to be here sipping on tea and nibbling on snacks.  Although it's just tea, it will cost you a good but fair amount.  This is a most go when visiting Gtown.  They have excellent service too."
Simone M.,"Honolulu, HI",2/2/2013,4.0,"SO many teas your head will spin! Service is also really good, as the waiters are very timely about refilling your pots and clearing away finished food items. Also, their soup is particularly delicious. Good to eat anytime really, but particularly warming on a cold day."
Ju L.,"Washington, DC",5/17/2013,3.0,Pros: Good assortment of teas and tea-ware. Knowledgeable staff. Food options. Quiet oasis within an urban jungle. 15 + years in operation. Cons: Teas aren't as authentic as advertised. Pricey. Request for additional tea cups will be rejected.
Alycia E.,"Washington, DC",1/12/2010,4.0,"I wish this tea salon were a little closer to my neighborhood, but it might be a good thing it's not because with the wide selection of teas and tea paraphernalia, I could easily drop a lot of money.The atmosphere is so much more relaxed than Teaism -- no crowds, no crush of people trying to order, no filthy tables with trays stacked up at lunch. I tried the pu-ehr for the first time and the server explained how to rinse the leaves one time, dump that water into the tray and then steep the tea (no more than 1 minute!). The wait staff changed our tea pots water once or twice to ensure it was still fresh. I tried the steamed salmon tea meal -- it was moist and the dressing with horseradish was fresh. When the weather warms up, I'll make the longer trek here to buy teas because I hope they stick around for awhile."
Jo Ann G.,"Irving, TX",7/23/2014,5.0,Ching Ching Cha....we are still talking about it after coming back home to Texas.  We may make a trip to DC just to go back and enjoy the wonderful food and tea.  The food was fresh and unique.  I have event tried to duplicate a couple of the recipes at home.  I love the Monkey King tea!  What a great experience!
K M.,"Washington, DC",6/26/2013,5.0,"Haha the name will always have me coming back! Great atmosphere and decor, I love what they did with the place. Everything is delicious. Sesame seed chicken especially (try it out, CHA!) If you're close it's a great spot to regular."
Thomas L.,"Germantown, MD",10/27/2010,4.0,"LoL! I couldnt stop laughing to myself. I was in the neighborhood with family from Texas and was wondering where to take them. (I dont spend a lot of time in Georgetown) This nice lady (Caucasian) recommended this place to us and I was like, ""Really lady? Just cuz we're a bunch of Asians doesn't mean we want Chinese!"" (In my mind of course). But I was pleasantly surprised. This is a very small quaint place where you can relax and spend some quiet time with a book or having a quiet conversation with friends. The hot teas that they sell are incredible! The flavors are astounding and I really enjoyed the small appetizers that they offer. It is pretty pricey for  what it is, but I think its worth it. Go here to relax! =3"
G. H.,"Santa Monica, CA",1/11/2012,5.0,"I love this place!! I am a Georgetown regular (for my shopping trips on foot) and have started to come here whenever I get a chance. The food is simple yet nutritious and delicious, and the teas are very special and aesthetically pleasing. The service is wonderful too. I usually order the tea meal which includes a tomato tofu soup and a bento box with rice, pickled shredded carrots, choice of salmon / tofu / chicken curry, and 3 servings of healthy vegetables from 4 options: squash / snow peas / kale / cabbage. The veggies usually come sitting in a light and tasty soy sauce, except for the cabbage which has a vinegar dressing. I've tried all the options, and the salmon is AMAZING!! Snow peas are very crisp and crunchy. Kale is probably the most nutritionally rich veggie option. I also love their tea eggs (eggs marinated with tea which have a special, subtle tea flavor) and their chicken roll which is basically a flakey, savory pastry with yummy chicken inside. As for teas, I'm very familiar with green and black teas, so on my visits here I've ventured more into herbal teas. I tried the Peach Blossom tea which is a pretty tea that unfurls from a hand-tied ball into a beautiful blossom in hot water -- pleasing to the eye but the taste didn't thrill me, not that it wasn't pleasant to drink however. I loved one of the Oolong teas so much that I've ordered it twice in a row. I can't remember its exact name, but it's either the Ginseng Oolong or the Phoenix Oolong. It is extremely fragrant and has a scintillatingly sweet aftertaste.The ambiance at Ching Ching Cha is very calm and peaceful, and is how I imagine a tea experience would feel in a farflung East Asian country. They also sell tea and tea wares to take with you, as well as other Asian treats such as pretty chopsticks and wooden trays. Be aware that there isn't a whole lot of seating, so they fill up quickly at peak times. You can sit at a regular table or take your shoes off and sit on floor pillows. I highly recommend coming here for a snack or a meal, and definitely for tea with a friend!"
Scarlet L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",8/25/2012,5.0,true zen! Wide range of tea collection. authentic Chinese decoration...I felt like I was in China when I came in. We could sit there for hours.
Danielle D.,"Silver Spring, MD",3/8/2014,5.0,"Amazing tea and super fresh food. The pineapple square was hot and crunchy, straight from the oven. Every tea is served specifically to the leaf and flavor. It was really impressive and worth the money."
Ang G.,"Washington, DC",10/14/2009,4.0,"Take your time and enjoy. You will walk out renewed :)+sGreat tea selectionTasty tea eggs and dumplingsGood homemade foodQuiet relaxing atmosphereAmiable service-sCould use more food optionsTips: Perfect place to get tea and tea sets... but bring $, they're pricey!Good for girl time... great tea, great company, great time guaranteed!"
Monika And Matt S.,"Washington, DC",5/14/2012,5.0,"Ching Ching Cha is a fantastic place to go on a romantic date - it's a quiet oasis in chaotic Georgetown, unique (especially the little area where you can take off your shoes and sit on pillows!) and drinking endless cups of tea makes for a relaxing, zen atmosphere. For a teahouse, they have surprisingly yummy savory dishes- the chicken roll and vegetable dumplings were our favorite appetizers. But the real treat is the amazing variety of teas. Don't hesitate to get something more expensive--like the golden needle--and plan to take some time to savor it, because each order of tea amounts to 6-8 cups worth. The teahouse doubles as a specialty tea store, making it a great place to buy gifts and treat yourself to some gorgeous and unique tea kettles. If you're interested in learning more about the teas, make sure to ask Ching Ching, the owner, to give you a recommendation. She's very friendly and knows everything there is to know about choosing and serving tea."
Phil J.,"Seattle, WA",12/5/2009,4.0,"I used to come here all the time.  Great place for a date, the tea is good and interesting, it's fun to work with the different tea accoutrements, and the owner is very friendly and willing to help show you how everything works.  You never feel rushed, the place is beautiful, and it's all very comfortable.The food is good for the most part, if not stellar.  The portions are small, but that isn't really a complaint.  I always leave feeling good!"
Gayle G.,"Fairfax, VA",12/13/2006,4.0,"Enough with the coffeehouse debate. I would much rather drink some tea,. And when I do, it is at this place. The decor is very zen. Ching Chang Cha is an Asian style tea house. There are a ton of comfy pillows to sit on or lean against while enjoying your tea of choice- and there are over sixty here to select from. The menu looks hand bound, and the chopsticks and chopstick rests are handmade and painted. The owner has been here every time I have stopped in. He waits tables!If you are hungry, order a bunch of tea snacks like dumplings or veggie or chicken rolls. The desserts here go perfectly with tea like the pastry made with lotus seeds.This place is also a store where you can buy tea sets, or maybe just a teapot. Oh, and don't forget to purchase some tea on the way out."
Crista S.,"Alexandria, VA",1/3/2010,4.0,"Love this place!  this is a great date place or a great place to catch-up with an old pal... if you want to take your parents to high tea and they appreciate asian culture, yes.  (If you're looking for more English high tea... I recommend the Mandarin Oriental hotel)The food menu is ideal: $12 for soup, 3 veggie sides, and 1 main dish- served in bento box.  tea is served individually- I like the ones that bloom into flowers in glass cups.  I kept on taking pictures of mine.  For new asian tea drinkers, don't get worried if you sip some leaves... when I was in China, it was common to get loose tea leaves stuck in your teeth.  Just do a mirror spot check.  I liked their desserts too- coconut tart is what we got as well as the ice grape tea drink (very sweet).  Parking: there's the M Street mall parking across the street.  If you don't mind throwing down $10 for parking, just save yourself the hassel.  It's so convenient.  If you like sitting down on the floor and drinking tea, do it!  there's even a cubby to put your shoes.  The server we had said the shop owners (including himself) are from Hong Kong and they go to China every couple months for tea... their gift shop for tea drinking ware and the tea itself is extensive and impressive.  I definitely will come back here again.  I'm so surprised a place like this exists in the busy Georgetown scene."
P M.,"Annandale, VA",11/11/2013,4.0,"Our visit was a unique experience with my older teens and friends. The location is a little sanctuary that is tucked away in busy Georgetown. I am not a big tea drinker but I admire the tradition of tea and the varieties. If you are looking for a place to get a mini-vacation away from the chaos stop here. Don't ask for sweetener, you will get a death stare. If you need sweetener, bring in your own but don't let the server know you have it -- grounds for banishment forever."
D. G.,"Washington D.C., DC",6/30/2012,5.0,"This is a perfect date spot in Georgetown. There are a few tables with chairs and a few tables where you sit on floor pillows- taking your shoes off in the traditional manner. The menu is filled with exotic teas and a few food selections. The chef will substitute items on the menu depending on the season and availability, so you will always get something fresh and delicious. They have a selection of teas, tea sets, books, and other Asian trinkets to browse and buy. It is a very relaxed atmosphere. The staff is happy to explain custom and practice.It is in Georgetown, so parking will be difficult (I always walk). This is not a Starbucks- English is a second language to the staff."
IH K.,"Washington, DC",3/9/2009,4.0,"I like how they incorporate the idea of drinking tea as a process.  I love the careful selection of appropriate teaware and the surrounding aroma from the dry teas for sale.  I adored their friendliness and knowledge.I was very surprised to see that their tea meals were very cheap.  $8 will get you soup, rice, 3 asian side portion vegetables and 1 entree selection to go with your rice.  It's the perfect amount of food to ward off hunger, but not overwhelm your metabolism.  The flavors are very much the same and leaves your taste buds clear enough to fully appreciate the main attraction - the tea."
Kathy Q.,"London, United Kingdom",3/24/2012,3.0,"This is a really nice and relaxing place for tea and/or lunch, a bit of an oasis from the exasperating Gtown crowds. The tea is all incredibly high-quality, lots of unusual varieties direct from China. It's pricey, but worth it. The menu is rather limited, mostly bento boxes. I had rice, several types of vegetables, and tofu in mine. Everything tasted fresh and was well-prepared. Not as good as Teaism though. But, go for the tea and atmosphere."
Dan F.,"Silver Spring, MD",4/21/2011,5.0,"Ching Ching Cha is one of my favorite places in D.C.  It's a tea shop in Georgetown with tranquil ambiance, lovely service, amazing tea (!), delicious treats, and it's perfect for a date, or for quality time with any special person in your life.  I love the dumplings, the tomato soup, the kale, the star of anise peanuts, and the miso glazed salmon.  I recommend pue-erh tea and the eight treasure tea, but really, all the tea is great.  You can usually get a table where you can take off your shoes and sit on cushions on the floor and soak in the relaxation.  They also have cute things for sale.  Go here."
Brian D.,"Bridgewater, NJ",2/26/2014,5.0,"This place is one of my favorite places on Earth.  It is a sanctuary of peace in the city.  The tea selection is outstanding and of high quality (though certainly a little pricey) and the food is wonderful.  The staff is friendly and takes great care to present your tea properly and show you how to steep, brew, smell and taste for the best possible experience.  This place is heaven for me and I always make sure to stop by whenever visiting D.C."
Sophie A.,"Manhattan, NY",1/27/2014,3.0,"Was visiting DC with my mother and we decided to have some tea with meal here given the overall pretty good reviews for this place. The seating area was quite limited and was packed on a Saturday afternoon and we had to share a table with another gentleman who did not mind. The tea and food were okay. It was kind of unique in its atmosphere but, other than that, not sure if we would be back again."
Minger M.,"Washington, DC",9/4/2009,4.0,"This place is a tranquil oasis in a busy location. I'm impressed that the owners had the vision and guts to open such a place so different from the glitzy stores that dominate our most fashionable part of town.The teas here are super.  They serve not just leafy teas but floral, herbal and other combinations, like dates and fungus."
Erin H.,"Arlington, VA",7/3/2011,5.0,"As far as I know, this is the most authentic Chinese tea house in the tri-state area.  Founder Ching is from Hong Kong and imports an incredible selection of Chinese teas, teaware and art.  The space is a beautiful, traditionally decorated, skylit restaurant in the heart of Georgetown.  The staff is friendly and the meals are simple but great to accompany a nice pot of tea.  Teas range from traditional Chinese served with authentic teaware to more modern twists like Tisanes and flower ball infusions.  If you are looking to experience a little traditional Chinese culture in DC, look no futher.  A fun place for groups or to read a book.  The teas are quite pricey and not necessarily the freshest...but they are imported from halfway around the world."
Cynthia T.,"Silver Spring, MD",1/9/2015,5.0,you could walk right past this place and not notice it but you would be missing one of the best little tea houses on the east coast-great variety of teas and very friendly helpful staff.
Jessica S.,"New York, NY",8/2/2008,3.0,"The decor is beautiful and sort of conducive to romance. Ladies, get a pedicure before coming, because you can sit on a pillow sans talons hauts. Take note, if your man is tall, sit at a table, and take off your shoes anyway. The tea is too expensive. The bummer thing is that you can't share a teapot, which is symbolically antithetical to connecting with friends or loved ones. However, the water is heated by flame, which makes for an outstanding brew, and you can re-fill your cup up to three times and still have a strong flavor.My friend got the Hibiscus and I got the Eight Treasures. The Hibiscus was sweet with tangy overtones. A winner. The veggie dumplings were disappointing and the almond cookies overpriced at $1.00/cookie. They offer a nice selection of iced teas, which is one of the most economical choices you can make. Watch out, because if you want to come late, this place closes early-usually by 9:00 p.m. My friend went by on a Friday night, she was so impressed by the tea the previous night, and they had unexpectedly closed early-by 7:00 p.m. Call ahead to check on their hours. Have a back-up plan, as many yelpers are noting that this place can get crowded quickly."
Nishant S.,"Pleasanton, CA",9/8/2012,5.0,"I came across this place while walking around Georgetown and thought I would check it out, and it's amazing! A very peaceful place, very quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Avenue. This was my first time in a traditional sit-down tea house, and I really enjoyed it. The food is a little expensive, but it is good. The tea was the best. Very relaxing sitting there sipping hot tea and very peaceful music. Sat there for a couple hours reading. It doesn't feel commercial at all and felt really nice to be able to go there and just disconnect from all the commotion."
Natalie D.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/2/2011,5.0,"The staff was anxious to help me find the perfect gift, the atmosphere was unique and charming.  A great place to meet someone for tea."
s s.,"Washington, DC",9/25/2013,4.0,"Food, tea, and staff are wonderful. The staff obviously takes a lot of pride in what they do. It's a incredibly calming space too. I highly recommend it. Try the lotus cookies - delicious!"
T L.,"Arlington, VA",3/19/2011,4.0,"Perhaps it is the skylights but this place feels like it is always warm in the daytime.  Just fyi for the summer season!  Have no fear though, try the refreshing iced teas!  My favorites are the grape and apple flavors.  I didn't enjoy the grapefruit as much because I prefer a sweeter taste.  I've had one or two of the hot teas which were good but I can't remember the names to make a recommendation.I've never had the food here but I have nibbled on the desserts.  I think the desserts are expensive for the amount you receive but the coconut tart and almond cookies are good.If you don't know what has been placed in front of you, as some teas come in complicated teapots, have no fear again, it will be explained!"
Karman L.,"Boston, MA",2/8/2008,3.0,Average tea place.It has the traditional feeling decor inside.  But the service was that great.  We just got a Ice-Tea to go instead of sitting down.
Carrie W.,"Washington, DC","10/14/2012
            





Updated review",1.0,"This place overcharged me on tip on my credit card.  I left around 17% (on the after tax price) and they increased it to OVER 20%.  I will NEVER go back to this place, and I warn anyone and everyone away from this TERRIBLE and DISHONEST establishment.  It may not have been a lot of money, but that kind of dishonesty makes me sick."
S L.,"Washington, DC",2/21/2013,5.0,"Cute decor, great service, and large selection of tea. Very relaxing place to go after dinner."
Kate F.,"Washington, DC",4/13/2008,5.0,"First, I would like to point out something to those who were offended by the name.  It means something like ""nice/pleasant tea"".  How dare they name a tea house that?  Second, what a retreat.  They do offer tea to go although I wouldn't recommend it.  Looking at the prices they may seem high for some water and leaves.  Remember, you are paying for the whole experience.  A friend got an artisan or blooming tea, it unfurls in the water.  It is a very relaxing and well-lit place.  It is a good retreat from DC.  It's very quiet.  The server tells you how long to steep your tea before drinking.  They refill the water (which rests on a small burner in the middle of the table) as much as you like.  It's definitely a place to sit and refresh for a while. They sell lots of cute tea related items and food here.  I bought a teacup with a top for loose leaf tea, it's beautiful.  I did not order food, but everyone in my party seemed to enjoy theirs.   A couple near us had two children with them.  They seemed bored out of their minds.  Also, I'd worry about younger children with the flame and boiling water.  Hire a sitter, the kids won't appreciate this place and your fellow tea drinkers will appreciate the peace you've afforded them."
Maria B.,"Alexandria, VA",2/24/2013,4.0,Floating jasmine tea superb... Great service and good starters
Jessica O.,"Washington, DC",12/14/2009,4.0,A peaceful tea shop - lovely tea & tasty almond cookies!
Hannah A.,"Washington, DC",6/1/2013,4.0,"Peaceful, sunny place to sit and drink tea. Their iced teas are good, too. Nice zen atmosphere. Lots of interesting items for sale."
Ina C.,"Westwood, MA",9/29/2007,3.0,"Everyone's rated this place extremely high, so I feel a little bad about giving them their lowest rating so far on Yelp. Yes, this place is extremely unique. Yes, they have really good-tasting tea. Yes, the location is prime. YES, the atmosphere makes you feel like you're miles from the city......But I had a very offputting experience tonight.I took some girlfriends out to show them the ""jewels"" of DC, of which I considered Ching Ching Cha one. We got there at 8:20 (they close at 9:00) and was utterly dismayed that they refused to seat us. Not only did they refuse to seat us - but the staff completely ignored us standing in the doorway waiting for seating. Very strange, and pretty disappointing. Maybe I'm being too harsh. But is it so bad to get to a restaurant 40 minutes before they close? I just really wanted some tea! So, use me as a cautionary tale and get there well before they close so you can enjoy the truly amazing teas that they have. They close at 9pm on Tue-Sat, 7pm on Sun, and they're closed on Mon."
Eva E.,"Washington, DC",12/10/2009,1.0,"On a Sunday afternoon, at 6:20pm, I walked into the teahouse trying to have a quiet lonely dinner by myself and purchase some loose tea as well as a couple of tea containers. I was in a great mood and was ready to unwind. .. The place is cute but the front desk man tried to convince me for over 7 minutes that they were closing the kitchen at 7 pm and that at 6:20 I was too late for dinner... or even tea. So I asked him if I should even bother to sit at a table and at least have a cup of tea ? He suggested I should NOT. I was just too late to be served, 40 minutes before they closed down the place for the night. I told him that his way of doing business was not very encouraging and that I may never come back. He replied SMILING that it would be OK ! I told him I wanted to purchase loose tea and a couple of containers but he was so ready to close and go home, he pretended he did not hear me.  One of the worst customer services in the world ! I have NOT tried the food nor the tea simply because the owners/managers were extremely unwelcoming. I was NEVER told before that it would be ""fine"" if I never returned to a restaurant simply for not knowing what time the place closed and for politely asking to be served 40 minutes before the kitchen closed.   Ugh.. I would NOT want to live in China. What horrible customer service. ... Would NEVER go back. Would NEVER recommend this place."
Jennifer R.,"Washington, DC",12/24/2009,4.0,"Wonderful selection of loose green teas and others in 4oz bags. After trying Dean and Deluca, Whole Foods, Teaism, and some other places around town, I was really starting to lose it in my search for loose genmaicha and plain rooibos. I finally found success at Ching Ching Cha. The service was good, the seating looked lovely for a cup of tea sometime, and the ceramics were nice.Recommended, especially for reasonably priced, loose green teas."
David W.,"Seattle, WA",9/23/2009,1.0,"After hearing about this place in the NY Times and having my brother-in-law and his wife enjoy the tea shop I thought it would be fun to visit while I was in DC. I don't get to travel much beyond the Northwest and visit teahouses so I thought it was a great opportunity to see what the tea culture was like in the east coast.We walked in and found the place very charming and relaxing. The decor is what I would expect from a Chinese tea house. The selection of tea and tea ware was good with teas to herbals and gaiwans to teapots.Unfortunately, that is where I leave the good and head toward the bad. Trying to figure out the tea selection was difficult since most teas had name nothing similar to the actual mandarin. Also, asking questions of the employees was useless due to the little English spoken by them (and my bad Mandarin) plus the complete lack of knowledge of their tea selection and even what ""gong fu cha"" means (I guess that could be a dialect problem). In the end I and my partner ordered what we were told are two Taiwanese oolongs. One turned out to be a Chinese Ti Gwan Yin and the other was a complete mystery. Tasted something close to ""milk tea""/jin xuan varietal. Not very good quality or taste. Don't think either were from Taiwan.Near the end of our stay we were given a bill for ~$40 for four people. A little much. Most tea houses I visit you are not charged the price of an ounce or two of tea for drinking a cup or gaiwan of tea. Also, looking at the teaware some of it was priced 50-100% more than what I can find elsewhere for the same product. I don't think that someone should pay $12 for a tea infuser I can buy for $6 elsewhere.In the end I don't think I can recommend this teahouse because of the lack of service, knowledge, quality, and price. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing but not good enough for me to ."
Karen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/3/2007,5.0,"True gem in the heart of busy Georgetown. The entryway is small but come inside and a serene sanctuary awaits you. The tea house is high ceilinged with glass ceiling panes which allow plenty of natural light inside. It reminds me of tea houses in old Chinese movies.Taking off your shoes before taking a seat is mandatory since you are sitting on a plush little pillow on the wooden floor. Your table is sturdy, polished wooden table. This place is perfect to relax -- I usually order the ginseng tea and little bits of appetizers (most are good) and just enjoy the quietness of the place.It's hands down the BEST teahouse I've ever been to. I have yet to find other teahouses even second rate to this one. If you know a teahouse as nice as this in Los Angeles area, PLEASE let me know. They also sell Asian cookbooks, knick knacks and little accessories. I highly recommend this place for a nice afternoon with friends."
Jennifer S.,"Arlington, VA",10/5/2006,4.0,"Can a teahouse/restaurant be considered an oasis? This one is -- so kick your shoes off and relax. Lower yourself onto a comfy red floor pillow and take in the soft tunes in the background while you bask in the light that fills the room from the skylight above. The vibe here consistently radiates soothe and calm. It's a place to sneak off from the hustle and bustle of Georgetown to a tranquil space to eat, sip tea, relax and read. But you can also shop - but only for items like their loose teas, tea pots, chopsticks, books and other tea related goods. I've personally only enjoyed tea here (jasmine blossom is the way to go if you like jasmine tea), but plan on sampling their fare also. I kept hearing about some puff pastry that had lotus seed paste inside, but they did not have it and apparently have not for a while. Ah well. The menus look very interesting though and reasonably priced, so I would still like to try. Many people were snacking on what appeared to be the 5-spiced nuts from the menu, as well as plenty of other dishes. And I did not spot anyone around me shouting out statements of disgust. That's always a good sign. The tea here doesn't come with a Lipton-price tag, but nor does Lipton offer us 50 something varieties of tea in a comfortable setting with affable and low key hosts for an interesting tea ceremony prepared as they would in China. The teas come in several varieties like: black, oolong, green and others. The scents that waft around this room are amazing yet delicate as you try to single out the one that smells best. How to decide with all these choices? What about a tea tasting? Any way you want to do it, just do it. This place is a haven smack in the middle of the busy city. And the tea...the star of the show...some of the best I've sipped."
Cathy D.,"Burke, VA",1/15/2007,4.0,"Okay, everytime I passed by this place I scoffed at the name and really took offense at it. However, my friend pointed out that it is actually a tea house and owned by Asian people. We checked it out and it was nice. They have little hor d'oeuvres dishes (like dumplings) to go with your tea (usually one person orders a small pot each and you can share). I got some kind of peach tea. The thing about these authentic teas is that you have to enjoy it for its natural flavors. For a person who loves to put sugar in her tea, it was hard for me to swallow down at first but I eventually got to savior the taste. They also sell tea paraphernalia here."
Nadine F.,"Brussels, Belgium",7/25/2007,3.0,"I had a fruity iced tea, and I'm not sure if it had any tea in it at all.  It just tasted like fruit punch.  The place itself is really cute, and I think it would be a great place to buy gifts for people you don't know very well."
Herschel M.,"Wheaton, IL",9/15/2010,5.0,"What a truly lovely, restful way to spend an afternoon.  The host is incredibly gracious and kind, and truly enjoyed explaining all the different tea services.I only wish I had taken more time to check out the wares for sales, but I know I will be back.  This could become an expensive habit!"
Karol U.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/13/2009,5.0,"Amazing place.  I felt like I was in that old Chinese antique shop.  So  much fun.  Service was great.  Light fare and amazing tea.  I had a green dragon tea,  a moon cake and some amazing dumplings and sauted squash.  All super yummy.  I could spend all day there.  A definite escape from the factory feeling of much of the city's hot spots.  I felt like I was visiting someone's home or an old converted temple somewhere.  Incredible!"
Crystal S.,"San Francisco, CA",4/30/2007,4.0,"This is one of those places that I wish that I could put in my pocket and bring back with me as a souvenir. Alas, I had to settle on some Jasmine Blossom tea instead.It may be considered a tourist trap, but it's Georgetown, the whole place is a tourist trap! When I visit D.C. again, I'll be sure to make a stop, the teas are great and the atmosphere is calm and beautiful, with pillows on the floor. Who can hate on pillows on the floor to sit on?"
Kendra K.,"Arlington, VA",4/30/2009,4.0,"A nice change of pace from the surrounding hustle and bustle of Georgetown (and especially Wisconsin Ave.), this place is quiet, full of natural light (high ceilings and skylights), and just an overall relaxing experience. If you're a teaficianado, then you'll appreciate the fact that every table comes with it's own teapot (kept constantly warm over an open flame) so that you are able to serve yourself at your own pace (and as far as I know, the water keeps a-coming--my friend and I polished off one pot, and received a refill without even asking). It's a bit pricier (teas start at $6, but most are around $10+) but keep in mind that you're paying for the atmosphere, and that you are serving yourself so it's nice to have that control. My friend and I easily spent an hour here, sipping away at our phoenix oolong (crisp, almost citrus-y) and green pu-ehr (very earthy, like drinking mulch--but I happen to love earthy teas ;) )."
Iris W.,"Philadelphia, PA",7/7/2010,3.0,"It seems a good place for tea; but overpriced for food.I went there for lunch. There were limited choices in the menu and the portion was very small. The side dishes (veggies) were very plain without taste. This may indicate that you have very healthy meals but actually not that delicate enough to me. Therefore given the price it charges for the food, I think there are some other nicer places for Asian food."
Renee W.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/25/2011,5.0,"Ching Ching Cha is one of my favorite places in the world. Holly, the owner, takes such care in every aspect to her business. Her team, like Desmond, have been working at the tea house for some 10 years since it opened. Everyone at Ching Ching Cha is knowledgeable on tea and take the time to teach their customer the proper way of serving and drinking each specific tea. Over the years, I must have ordered 100 meals there and each one is made to perfection. If you are seeking a real tea experience in a tranquil and beautiful setting then Ching Ching Cha is your destination."
Suzanne P.,"Arlington, VA",12/1/2008,4.0,Went here with the girls for Sunday afternoon tea. The ambience was amazing. We sat on pillows on the floor and enjoyed the orange blossom tea. We were prepared for it to be $7. the dumplings were delicious and the coconut tart was too. Don't come here expecting quick service and to leave in 30 minutes. You want to savor the experience. Some people brought journals to write in or a book.
Lori R.,"Germantown, MD",12/30/2013,5.0,"I absolutely love Ching Ching Cha and I always recommend it to others who have not yet been there! The store front is a little confusing at first, but when you walk inside, it's a calm, serene atmosphere compared to the bustling of Georgetown. One of my friends is a tea fanatic and can speak some Mandarin. He was able to practice some of his Mandarin with the people running the restaurant. I love the varieties of tea available and being able to purchase my own loose leaf tea to take home. There are also tea cups that you can purchase. The selection of tea in their menu is very nice. I like that they range from affordable to pricey teas. Most places I've gone to only give you one cup of tea, but here, it's practically unlimited because they will make sure the pot of water on your table is full by either pouring more water into your pot, or replacing the pot with a full one. If I order food to go with my tea, I always choose one of their meal boxes, which basically looks like a bento box. There are several appetizers as well. The varieties of tea far outnumber the types of food that can be ordered, but personally I am completely fine with that since I usually order just a meal box. Sometimes the restaurant has been full of people, and other times it is slow. My favorite time to go is on a Friday or Saturday evening if it is slow because I feel like I can more fully enjoy the calm environment with my tea and meal box."
sarah s.,"Alexandria, VA",1/5/2009,4.0,"What a gem! I'm a big fan of tea, but usually British-style, and decided to try  Chinese tea. This place is so quiet and serene,  it's like you're not even in DC. The tea list was amazing, the service was great, and it's just a magical and relaxing way to spend an afternoon. It is expensive however, but like others have said, I guess you're paying for the ambiance and whole experience as well. We had the chicken dumplings and veggie dumplings which were both good. Also the boiled peanuts (not just a Southern thing!) and my fave, the chicken curry roll. A fun and relaxing experience!"
Chris G.,"Washington, DC",11/10/2008,5.0,"One rainy day, a true biblical deluge, my wife and I made plans to meet one of our friends at Ching Ching Cha. We parked somewhat nearby and sprinted up the hill, dashed inside, and were instantly transported.We met up with our friend (dripping wet from waiting for a bus), the staff sat us at a table and fired up a burner and put a kettle of water on top. We ordered our tea, and some dumplings. When the waiter came back with our 3 tea cups, each a bit different, filled with a different tea, and specific instructions on how to best enjoy each. It's a truly serene place. That particular day there were very few shoppers on the streets in Georgetown, but in subsequent visits I found that Ching Ching Cha is still an oasis even if the sidewalks are overflowing with pedestrians.I know that it looks kind of surprising when you see a cup of tea for $7, but keep in mind that you're going to be there for an hour or more. It's about the experience.I have found the food to be pretty nice, especially the lotus seed pastry. The dinner where you pick 1 meat, a couple of vegetables and some rice is very nice, but not amazing. I like it a lot because it's wholesome and tastes very fresh. If I don't go to Ching Ching Cha every few weeks, withdrawal overcomes me. It is a real gem."
Kenneth L.,"San Francisco, CA",7/16/2009,3.0,"Prefect way to prepare for a day out for museums. The tranquil teahouse offers delicate food and serene Chinese teas. Served in small portions, the food is light and healthy. Sit down and watch the tea leaves infuse before taking a sip. The wooden interior mingles well with the scent, creating a unique Chinese style."
Nelson C.,"Glen Allen, VA",7/6/2011,4.0,"The ambiance is amazing. As soon as you come in you just feel relaxed. The staff was very friendly and the décor put you at ease. They had a good selection of light food items but my friend and I only had tea. The only bad think about this place is that they have a handful of iced teas. I get it it's a tea house but during the summer in DC when it can get over 100 degrees, with humidity, you want a better selection. I will come back during fall and winter to try their hot teas."
Glaciala A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/24/2009,4.0,"Great atmosphere. Tea is expensive. Is it always this expensive? I'm not a tea connoiseur, so I don't know. If you're looking for somewhere new to go, try it."
Adrian B.,"Falls Church, VA",7/26/2008,1.0,"I met friends at this place for a light lunch.  I found the staff to be cold and standoffish.  The food was good, the portions were sensible, but the wait staff seemed as though they could give half of a sh*t.The tea is somewhat expensive, but the tea was good and the ambiance of the restaurant (not the staff) was nice.  I had a grapefruit iced tea which was delicious, but the waitress did not bring the menu again so I could order another tea.Bottom line: the tea is good, the food is good, and the service is SEVERELY lacking.  Had I not been with friends that knew the owner, I would have walked out before I sat down--turns out my gut was right regarding the service."
P W.,"New York, NY",10/14/2007,3.0,Cute little Chinese tea house in the heart of Georgetown.  The service is lacking.  We had intended to have some tea and some food but ultimately decided to get iced teas to go.  The Apple Iced Tea is refreshing and only $2.50!
David P.,"Washington, DC",7/4/2008,4.0,"honestly, $7 for a tea, WOW.  that is expensive.  but .... the zen feeling, the courteous staff, the experience, is worth the $7.   take some of the tea to go.  I got the orange blossom tea, and in the glass, it becomes the gorgeous flower that is something to see.I recommend this place to sit quietly and contemplate things in your life.  There are not so many places in DC to do this, so relish this one."
Iniko B.,"Seattle, WA",4/20/2007,3.0,"Attrocious name. Horrid tourist trap next to the Pleasure Chest in Georgetown. As a teahouse, they don't serve food, just cookies, and the floor is a jumble of Oriental tourist schlock. However, their two redeeming qualities are courteous service and a delicious, refreshing array of teas."
Sarah M.,"Bellevue, WA",5/31/2007,5.0,"my old roommate lives in dc and wanted to take me to her little refuge before i got to the airport for a day of connecting flights and air turbulance.being the frou frou girl i am at heart, a tea house that spoke to my roomie's even frou frouer heart got me looking forward to the joint. what i found when i entered was such a delighful little place! first off, the ambience is soooo peaceful. right of m street, with the heat starting to go higher and higher, the shade of the entrace, then the expanse of the high ceilings really calmed me down quickly. it was cool, quiet, and very very zen. i instantly fell in love-seriously, the high ceiling gave it a feeling of spaciousness and the trinkets, tea pots, and bags of fragrant tea was food for the soul. the man, um...manning the store was polite, hospitable and a great server. he quickly took our orders and didn't think we were crazy when we kept switching tables (my stick thin ex-roomie was not handling to the mild ac). we both sat and ordered a tea meal. the miso salmon was delicious, as was all of our veggies that we ordered-(kelp, cabbage & snow peas). it all came in a rectangle bento box-each veggie in it's own little place, fix, rice, & a bowl of soup. the food was all very simple, clean and comforting. i also enjoyed the apple iced tea, which, was not as good as my friend's grapefruit tea, but still, very cleansing and refreshing.it was a great place to be taken to-a definitely must hit for girls out for a light meal that leaves them feeling delicate, nourished, and tended to in the most simplest of ways."
Shannon D.,"New York, NY",8/12/2012,5.0,"great little find! presentation and selection of teas is top notch, nice traditional seating, veggie dumplings were fantastic - the mongolian dumplings not so much"
Courtney A.,"Arlington, VA",2/27/2011,3.0,"Food was tasty and reasonably priced. A nice but not vast assortment of tea on the menu, and tea was a little pricey (about $7-10 per person). My only complaint is that they refuse to serve sugar, honey or milk with their tea.  I definitely enjoy my tea with some sugar and if I'm spending $10 on a cup of tea, I want to enjoy it my way. So keep this in mind when ordering...and maybe bring your own sugar."
Christine G.,"Washington, DC",9/18/2007,5.0,"I met some friends here on a Saturday, and it was such a pleasant experience. I don't remember what I ate, but they were good nibbles, and the tea was great--closest thing approaching a true tea house that I have experienced in America. As other Yelpers have noted, not cheap, but you're paying for the experience."
Christine E.,"Santa Clara, CA",4/15/2007,4.0,"Wonderful hang out on a lazy Sunday afternoon!  I had tea and a late lunch with a couple friends here today, while it was cold and rainy outside.  It was so nice to have some hot tea, warm miso soup and the mustard miso salmon.  I tried the peach blossom tea, which was delish!  Gotta wait for the flower to open up and then you'll know it's ready to drink!  :)  We sat on pillows on the floor surrounding a coffee table.  I almost felt like taking a nap, it was that cozy.  You can also buy some pretty fancy tea sets here."
