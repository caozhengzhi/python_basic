Chad P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",9/15/2017,5.0,"Started with bruschetta! Wonderful. Also with fried green tomatoes. Crispy. Dipping aioli was great!For entree, had the Rib Eye medium-well. Great! Sides were Sautéed spinach with garlic. Green peas, cucumber and mint. Great!Dessert included cookies, ice cream, and decaf Americano. Lovely!"
Carmen V.,"Washington, DC",9/14/2017,4.0,"I ordered the breakfast chicken and waffles and promptly fell in love.The chicken was fried to tender deliciousness and the waffle was thick. I couldn't even finish it. Luckily, my friend lended a helping fork. We walked in with a group of six around 1:45 and were seated in 15 minutes. Words of wisdom: the breakfast kitchen closes at 2:30, so get your orders in quick if you come late to brunch like us! Luckily, the waitor warned us. If you want a bright and cheerful atmosphere, this is the place to go. The windows are huge--letting in tons of natural light. Get a cocktail while you're here. The bartender kind of sits in the middle of the space. Our table was right next to the bar, so I saw a procession of mixed-drink-mania floating by. All looked delectable and carefully prepared.Overall: This place is incredibly accomodating. The waitor was slower than most, but the restaurant was PACKED...so I give him a pass."
Zhou W.,"Salinas, CA",9/14/2017,3.0,"Founding Farmers is one of those DC restaurants everyone talks about. I had a friend stay with me during the summer and she loved the experience...and maybe the service was really backed up that day, but I found the food sub-par. The place, however, is beautiful--nicely decorated, and the restaurant is packed with people that gives the ambiance of Founding Farmers the place to be on a Sunday brunch. Back to the food. I ordered the eggs benedict, while my friends ordered the peanut butter toast with chocolate pearls and bananas. While the toast was good (and photogenic...I regret not taking pics *facepalm*), I didn't think the plate was worth the price. Then, my eggs benedict came in. the eggs were entirely cooked through. Not the worst issue to have, but I order eggs benedict because restaurants can poach eggs in a way that I cannot. I was kind of upset! I sent the dish back, and the waiter was really nice to replace the dish. However, this time around, the eggs were just barely soft boiled. Overall, the ambiance was nice, and the waiting staff were really nice and thoughtful--however, given the food, I might just need to give this place another shot on a less busy day."
Ben L.,"Queens, NY",9/4/2017,5.0,"I went to this place because it is in the top ten most reviewed restaurants on Yelp and I thought this place was fucking awesome!!!!! The place is hugely popular, so make sure you get there early, my party got lucky since we only waited 30 mins on a Saturday at 9:30am. The restaurant is a pretty big size with two floors, I liked the decor, it was modern and super comfortable. The restaurant is only a few blocks from the White House so we walked there afterwards.The food:Strawberries & Cream Farmhouse Waffle- This was the shocker dish and the favorite of the table. The waffle was from the recommendation from our awesome waitress. Truth be told, I wouldn't have ordered it since it seems kinda basic but it was so damn good. The waffle had a great mix of soft center yet crunchy exterior, I really loved the strawberries and their homemade whip was excellent. This is a must order. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Hangover Hash- Chili, pimento cheese, cheddar. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this dish, it had so much cheesy and potato-y goodness. There is a slight kick from the pimento that cuts some of the richness and the texture of the egg was nice but too bad the yolk was not runny =( It really speaks volumes how much I enjoyed this dish even though the yolk was overcooked. Only if that yolk was runny, it woulda been heaven! yelp.com/user_local_phot…Banana Foster Buttermilk Pancake- The texture of the pancake was so light and airy, I really enjoyed the flavor and I liked how it wasn't too sweet. I enjoyed this dish but the bites do become a little too repetitive so this is definitely a dish to share. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice- I never mention beverages in my reviews but their OJ was excellent. Black Pepper Maple Thick-Cut Bacon- I thought the flavor of the bacon was great but I wasn't a fan of how thick cut the bacon was. I like my bacon to be crispy and this bacon came off a bit chewy. It was just so so."
Siyun Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/7/2017,3.0,"I was really excited to try Founding Farmers with so many good reviews, but it ended up being my least favorite restaurant during my trip to DC. I felt like the prices were a bit high for what they were serving.We were seated quick when we arrived at our reservation time (7:30pm). The restaurant is huge! I believe there is two floors. We ordered:Fried Green Tomatoes ($9)-These came with two spreads. They were just okay. I wouldn't order these again.Short-ribs with side of mash potatoes and Mac and Cheese ($30)-The short ribs were good but a lot of it was fat and we couldn't eat it. The mash potatoes and Mac and cheese were okay. Kale Salad ($9)-This is our effort in trying to not be complete fatties. The salad was good and refreshing. I'm glad we got this since everything else order was very heavy.Overall an okay place for dinner. I don't think I would come back as there are better restaurants in DC with less of a crowd and more unique options."
Christopher V.,"Chicago, IL",8/30/2017,3.0,"Founding Farmers is cool. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. ..just cool. The bacon with Black Pepper Maple Glaze is incredible, everything else is solid. The pancakes had the crispy edges I deem mandatory, but didn't have much flavor. The breakfast sausage links are the size of brats. I didn't like the flavor so sent them back for more bacon. The Leek Hash Browns were a missed opportunity to be great. 2 stars for breakfast, added additional star for service."
Lana Y.,"Grand Prairie, TX",9/13/2017,3.0,The food was not that exquisite for the amount of time we waited to eat here. We found this place on yelp and it was last minute and of course we didn't know we needed reservations otherwise we would have decided on this place much earlier in the day and made a reservation.  The crowd here...snooty and not really my style.  The food was ok and the service was fine....not really any complaints.  No one went out of their way to make us feel welcome. After waiting so long...being at the point of no return since we had already waited so long...gotta eat here now.  Very small waiting area for the amount of people that had to wait. It was just a very bad experience.Don't even go near this place without a reservation...if you haven't gathered that from the above statements.

Updated review",4.0,"I had such an incredible meal at Founding Farmers two years ago, I knew I had to come back. Despite the 30 minute wait, we hungrily waited and my expectations were high. I was starving. We placed our order fairly quickly once we got seated since we had a lot of time to familiarize ourselves with the menu while waiting.Got the prosciutto toast to start and it was as delicious as remembered. Toasted crostinis with a a fig marmalade, marscopone, balsamic vinegar and thin cuts of meat. Absolutely divine and we gobbled them up fairly quickly.My meal, the 14oz prime rib ""salt crusted"" was disappointing however. While the food came out very quickly, I did not enjoy the prime rib. The actual meat had no seasoning and only the side of it had such a heaping amount of salt it was actually inedible. It was also very chewy and less tender than previous prime rib's that I've had. I ordered it medium rare and to their credit was cooked to order. The garlic mashed side that I had with it was delicious though.My wife + her niece enjoyed their meal immensely. I left sad and a little disappointed because after waiting for 30 minutes and two years for a repeat experience, it was not the incredible-ness that I wanted it to be. Guess I should have ordered something else...The waitress did come by to check up on us, but when she asked how everything was, I was busy chewing the chewy piece of meat and my wife and niece quickly remarked that it was ""very great."" I'm not always one to speak up, but I may have said something, but at the same time I didn't want to sour the experience that my wife and her niece were having with the food.I'll still come back, but I will probably avoid their steak / prime rib dishes next time."
Chris R.,"Alexandria, VA",9/11/2017,4.0,"I've been to the Founding Farmers in McLean, but this was the first time I'd made it to this location and for the most part, for breakfast anyway, I think I prefer this location.The service was a little spotty and kind of slow in an only mildly annoying way, but the food was excellent.  When I arrived, I was told it would be a 30 minute wait, but they actually texted me after about 15 minutes.  They seated us a family style table meaning there were three groups of people at one table - none of whom knew each other...kind of like restaurants in Europe.Unlike the brunch that's served at the McLean location, this one serves traditional breakfast.  I ordered the FF Breakfast with scrambled egg whites, chicken apple sausage, grits, and an English muffin.  The egg whites, which can easily be boring, were AMAZING and seasoned perfectly.  The chicken apple sausage was seasoned perfectly as well (I actually wish they had given me two instead of one).  The grits were creamy and cooked well.  The English muffin was good and was unexpected because it was an actual, thick, homemade sourdough English muffin.  Nothing about the  food was bad at all.The reason for the four stars was because the service was a bit slow at times.  My friend ordered the French toast (which was also amazing), but oddly, it came within a few minutes after it was ordered, but then the rest of the food came out about 20+ minutes later which I thought was a bit rough.  Also, I would really like to know what the nutrition information for the food at this place is.  Being 2017, it should be readily available, but unfortunately it's not.I will definitely be back.  I love this place - the food is awesome."
Michael B.,"Lexington, MA",9/12/2017,4.0,"Founding Farmers is a fantastic concept that delivers high end food that is fresh from local producers and made to order for you.  Everything about Founding Farmers is top notch including their food sourcing, preparation, service, and most importantly the end product.  We stopped in for breakfast and were delighted with our first experience.  Freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juices and an Americano alongside water served in classic, old milk bottles adorned the rustic table.  The entire look and vibe of the restaurant fits the total food experience too.  First on the menu to try were the beignets.  A brown paper bag of made to order balls of delight; crispy outsides and moist insides topped with a sprinkling of powdered sugar.  They were hot and went great with the coffee and the three dipping sauces (chocolate, caramel, and berry).  Sinfully delicious!  For main meals we ordered the Farmers breakfast with 2 eggs any style, crispy hash browned potatoes, choice of side (how can you refuse the applewood smoked bacon) and choice of bread which we chose a buttered and toasted ciabatta.   We also ordered the traditional eggs Benedict serviced with ham over a toasted English muffin and served with those same crispy hashed browns.  Everything looked great, was well prepared and presented, and tasted just as wonderful.  The fact that the poached eggs were not overly smothered in hollandaise sauce was a bonus as each bite could taste the egg, the ham, the muffin and the sauce.  Well done!There was no room for dessert, but we are sure to stop in next time and try the lunch and dinner menus too."
James B.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",9/11/2017,3.0,"Holy moly this place is busy! The hype is real, but it doesn't live up to it.That said, if you plan on coming here without a reservation during peak times, the wait can be up to 2.5 hours so make a reservation! I made a reservation and they honored the time almost to the dot even when it was super busy. Fried Chicken & Waffles (2.5 Stars**) - one of the most popular dishes, which I thought was good, but not great. I thought that the skin was way too soft and damp for fried chicken. I was expecting the fried chicken to be more crispy.Service (4 stars****): the servers are friendly and efficient which is to be expected in a place that's this well-reviewed."
Kathryn T.,"Manhattan, NY",8/19/2017,4.0,"I finally did it. I tried Founding Farmers. After years of having this place on my list (thank you, Food Network), I've finally been able to check it off the list. So what can I say that over 9000 people haven't?Here's what you need to know:1. The reservation is absolutely necessary. Even so, expect to wait at least 30 minutes to get seated. I went in on a Monday night and found myself waiting longer than some other top restaurants in NYC.2. The portion sizes and meal options are so reasonable. Keep in mind that you're here for typical American fare. Don't expect anything too far out of the new American realm.3. The prices make this a good spot for everyone. There's a range of choices to fit everyone's budget.4. That cornbread. Get it or your meal didn't happen.5. Drinks are made of the Founding Farmers' distilled alcohols, which made them ridiculously delicious. It's a solid place that's a reasonable price but I wasn't completely blown away. It's a solid choice in DC but I think there are other delicious/more trendy options in the DC area"
Kelly C.,"Anaheim, CA",8/20/2017,4.0,"Came here for some prime rib, medium rare. It was a little overcooked to medium well but still good. Became more chewy and dry towards the end. Some parts were very salty tho but then again it's called the salted prime rib lolBut omg the spinach and mac and cheese that came with it was soooo delicious! Very savory and I liked the pasta used for the Mac and cheese :)"
Nita R.,"Sacramento, CA",8/15/2017,5.0,"Ok so this was a great experience!  First kudos to the reception staff. I had made a mistake about the day of our reservation. They found it from the day before and squeezed us in (party of 6).  They have a line of people waiting for seating and trust me it is so worth it. My only complaint is that I couldn't take the restaurant with me. So for starters we had the absolutely delicious, crispy and freshest potato chips. Yes they are house made with all this yummy goodness for dips. We also had AMAZING deviled eggs. Yep with seafood yep yum, yum. I ordered a vanilla milk soda and that was different,  but good too. For dinner on the table was thus delicious delicious chicken, tender succulent short ribs a phenomenal pork chop....can you say AMAZIN. Really. Then to top it off dessert no we didn't have time but I had to do it. Had to have the mousse for two and the carrot cake. Makes me wanna cuss it was so good."
Iris S.,"Providence, RI",9/9/2017,5.0,"This place is as good as I remember! As I planned my sister's trip to DC, this was the top of my list of places to dine. We made a reservation for 7 pm and were seated around 7:15. (This place is insanely busy! Do not try to come here without a reservation... we came on a Thursday and it was still packed!). This location is a dual leveled, rustic restaurant with a mixture of communal tables and private tables. The bar is stocked with every liquor you can imagine. The waiting area is lined with jars of preserved fruits and vegetables. It is filled with cooking books that you can look at as you wait. We shared the clementine cocktail (which was very refreshing. Strong pour and plentiful amount), We started with the brie/apple/caramalized apple bread app (this was HUGE. This starter has three delicious 5 inch pieces of freshly made bread with the toppings as listed. We couldn't finish it and brought it back to our hotel for breakfast. Stores well at room temperature). For entree we shared the reuben (melt in your mouth beef on thick cut homemade corn? Bread and lightly dressed julienne Cole slaw with just a hint of thousand island) and the ahi tuna salad (lots of course greens, fresh chunks of ahi tuna, fried wonton skins and delicious dressing). We did not have room for dessert but I am sure it would have been fantastic. We could have went to a new restaurant for dinner but I am glad we chose this one. Now if only they would open a few satellite restaurants in other cities..."
Tung D.,"New York, NY",8/10/2017,4.0,"Lived up to its hype.I ordered the short ribs and it was very tender, and the sauce was very good - not as overly sweet like regular BBQ sauce. The meat was very enjoyable and had nice meaty flavor. The double whipped mashed potato was also very tasty. The nice flavor of potatoes really stood out! It was creamy but not overly creamy. The melon salad was also good. Everything in this dish was very well balanced.The only thing I didn't like was the Rikey soda. It was basically lemonade with some syrup for $4.Price was a little high-end. $40 for this treat. Make sure you reserve on OpenTable. I first got here in the morning, but wasn't interested in the breakfast menu, so came back for lunch instead.Convenient location near the National Mall too!"
Chloe G.,"Kansas City, KS",8/7/2017,5.0,"I truly can't say enough about how amazing Founding Farmers was. I am so disappointed they aren't in Kansas City. I was in town for work and they were recommended to us. We loved it so much we went their twice. From appetizers to deserts, everything was delicious. We had excellent service both times and truly enjoyed our meals.The first night we had the bacon lollies and the prosciutto bread. I had ravioli for my entree and tried the beignet for desert. All of it was perfect, but far too much for me to eat. The beignets are definitely for a bigger group of people to share. The second night we had the crab dip, I got gnocchi, and we all got a slice of apple pie. That crab dip was one of the best I've ever had. I didn't love the gnocchi as much as the ravioli, but still good. The apple pie was heaven. Others in group got steak and shrimp risotto. They raved about their meals as well. This is a must stop when you're in DC. Atmosphere is spot on, service is excellent, and food is top notch."
Sheila C.,"Union City, CA",8/3/2017,2.0,"Everyone recommended this place to us so we definitely had to try! We made a reservation for Friday around 4.30pm since that was the only slot available. The next slot would be at 9.45pm and that was too late for us. When we got there, we had to wait a while to get seated. The place was really busy. We got cornbread for our appetizer. We didn't realize it was going to be big so my bf ordered two. I got a scallop risotto and my bf got crab cakes. My bf also ordered us some drinks. The cornbread was delicious and huge! I basically got full eating that. My scallop risotto looked yummy but it didn't taste good. The scallop was okay but the risotto was really hard. Tasted like uncooked rice, bleh. It was also a bit salty. My bf's crab cakes wasn't good at all. They made two crab cakes but they were really small. It came with fries and spinach. The crab cake tasted more like bread. Very disappointing! :( Despite the food not exceeding our expectations, service was pretty good. Our server was nice and attentive. I would like to come back and try something different. Hopefully we'll have a better experience the next time around."
Zach L.,"Washington, DC",8/10/2017,3.0,"I know, I know, this place has been open for years now and I'm just finally getting around to checking it out. I've been for brunch at farmer's, fishers and bakers which I enjoy even if the food isn't amazing.Well, I finally stopped by for a weekday lunch and this place was packed. Packed as in not enough room to wait inside, packed. No worries, we had a reservation which I highly recommend here otherwise you might be waiting awhile. I tried the cornbread to start which was actually surprisingly delicious and my favorite thing I ate here. I also tried the ahi tuna poke salad which was fine but nothing special. The mashed red potatoes, again solid. And some of the lobster Mac and cheese which was pretty disappointing. They do give you a hefty portion of lobster (just ok flavor wise) but as a big Mac and cheese fan I was pretty unimpressed. The pasta was way too chewy, the portion of noodles was small, the bread crumbs had an odd taste to them, and the cheese they use is all wrong. I would save your $28 and order something else than the lobster Mac and cheese. Overall I left relatively confused why this place draws such big crowds when there are far better restaurants downtown. Then it dawned on me, there really aren't many decent full service restaurants in this section of downtown. There are a few equally mediocre options in foggy bottom but those are basically all national chains. This immediate area could use a few more restaurants!"
Claudia R.,"Nashville, TN",8/6/2017,4.0,"What a hip spot. Definitely a go to for locals and tourists alike. Came here late at night and they still had a 45 minute wait, so this place is really happening. But they actually got us seated a little quicker than that which was nice.Friendly staff. Waiter was attentive and knowledgeable on the menu (I'm vegan so I have to be picky). Speaking of vegan, they've got tons of meatless options, which was nice! I got the cauliflower ""steak"". Paid $16 for some cauliflower put on the grill, but hey, you're paying for the ambience I guess.My friend got the ahi salad which looked great! They have a great drink and dessert menu as well. Would've gotten some sorbet if I hadn't been so full!Loved this place and the whole environment. A neat spot in DC."
Abhishek S.,"Pflugerville, TX",7/28/2017,5.0,"Finally got a chance to check out Founding Farmers on our recent trip to DC. Pro tip: please call and make a reservation in advance, typical wait times are around 1.5-2 hrs. We saved the wait by calling in advance, and were seated right away. Note that you won't be seated unless all members of your party arrive.The servers always had a smile on their face and were super friendly and nice. The menu choices were plenty and the portions were huge. There is something for every palette. The dessert we ordered was god for 4 people and there was plenty left to take home.Would love to come back and try other things off their menu, loved the experience!"
KC W.,"San Francisco, CA",9/2/2017,5.0,"I heard so many good things about Founding Farmers prior to relocating to DC, and to say I enjoyed this would be an understatement. My friend and I both ordered the chicken and waffles and WOW we were blown away. The chicken was so tender and juicy, and it was fried perfectly crispy. The waffle was the fluffiest waffle I've ever eaten, and the maple syrup that went with it had cinnamon sticks in it, which made it so fragrant. The mac and cheese was very simple but delicious, and the potato salad (I swapped out the green beans because I'm picky) was refreshing with tiny bits of celery and cauliflower. I also had the Ward Eight cocktail while my friend had the Clementine Cooler - both were tasty and the alcohol wasn't too overpowering. Service was great too - our server gave us recommendations as soon as we told her it was our first time there, she kept us updated on when our food/drinks would arrive, and she checked up on us regularly to make sure we were satisfied with our meal. It was packed when we arrived at lunch hour on a Friday, but luckily we made a reservation ahead of time - we actually were a little late, but thankfully they held our table for 15 minutes. There are metro stations just a few blocks away, so it's very easily accessible. I'll definitely be bringing out-of-town friends here and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"

Updated review",5.0,"WHAT AN AMAZING LOCATION.Everyone suggested i make  reservation so i did and that was helpful since there was a wait for 10:30 am on a friday.Stuffed french toast with berries is probably the best french toast i've ever had in my life. that is not an exaggeration. the combination of cream and bread was like none i've ever had. i'm sad thinking about how i'll have to go back to dc just to get my craving satisfied.i also got the black pepper maple bacon which was the perfect combination of sweetness to bacon. and they don't skip on the portion sizes. three hearty pieces of thick cut bacon, that don't break apart at the touch of a fork.the crab cake Benedict was okay. i'm not a fan of runny eggs so that wasn't the best combination for me. the crab cake is deconstructed but the flavor was good."
Natalie M.,"San Francisco, CA",7/23/2017,5.0,"I'm writing this as I'm still processing the experience of Founding Farmers. Wow! This place was crowded! We were told it'd be an hour and 15 minute wait but we were able to get seats at the bar. I ordered a Chelsea's Manhattan to start. Mmmm. This one had a nice hint of bitters and orange zest. Just great! We shared a brie, apple and onion jam flatbread. The onion jam was probably the main star of this dish. The flatbread was buttery and was savory. The apple and brie went really well with the onion jam. These onions were perfectly sweetened! Now for the entrée. I got the yankee pot roast and wow! I've had pot roast so many times and this is the best I've ever had. The pot roast was so tender. There were also celery, carrots, green beans, and mashed potatoes at the bottom of the dish. I loved that it was topped with fried onions. It paired so well with it all! It was a generous portion for sure. I tried to think of what could possibly be the seasoning so I could recreate this dish lol. Cinnamon? Rosemary? They have a cookbook apparently so I'll have to check that out. I loved this dish and savored each bite! Overall, it's a fun environment (a little loud but lively). Our server was great and had awesome recommendations. I would come visit this place again for sure!"
Sarah S.,"Fullerton, CA",7/24/2017,4.0,"I'm going to start with the cons:Water smelled like wet dog and so did the table we sat on. Doesn't come with ice unless you request it. Fried Chicken was dry so soak it in the watery maple syrup. It tasted like baked chicken. I was not a big fan We called in to make a reservation and we didn't have to wait. Your whole table needs to be there. Pros: Corn bread skillet $5 SO GOOD with the honey butter omg. The bread is like buttermilk and melts in your mouth. The best corn bread I've had. Please get this, you can't go wrong. It has actual whole kernels in it. Fried green tomatoes $8. Comes with around 4 slices and two types of sauces. One that was more sour and curdy and the other one was a yummy cilantro mayo like sauce which was my favorite. Both provide a different pungent type of flavor and its not like many others. It's not something you'd expect and it's unique. Definitely try it and share with your table. Chicken and waffles $16 comes with perfectly seasoned green beans, Creamy mac and cheese, two pieces of chicken and two pieces of waffles. Everything about this plate was great except like I said earlier, chicken was dry on both my order and my friends order. It tasted baked but the skin coating was yummy. Try dipping this chicken into the cilantro sauce if you get the fried tomatoes. Salmon: melts in your mouth, perfectly seasoned. Once it starts to get cold, it tastes drier so eat quick. Yummy mashed Potatoes, Chinese Broccoli, pretty good. Fish and chips: they're okay, nothing special. Comes with unsalted chips and fries.. 3/5"
Priya R.,"Washington, DC",8/5/2017,4.0,"Founding Farmers has a big rep in DC, and I sometimes wonder if the reason for it is because consistency can be hard to find here. In any case, I've been here six or seven times and it's a reliable, reasonably-priced place with an atmosphere for any occasion (good to take out-of-town guests especially). Definitely make a reservation and expect to wait a few minutes regardless. Service is always friendly and fast - they really turn those tables around, especially when I went today for Sunday morning breakfast/brunch.Brunch is really good with the staples, like eggs, bacon, and grits. The beignets are definitely worth sharing for the table - super light with three delicious dips (raspberry, caramel, and chocolate). I got the chicken and waffles today which was good, although the chicken pieces were quite small compared to any other DC restaurant serving the dish. Not a huge fan of the gravy (not flavorful, just heavy/creamy), but it was served on the side anyway. Try the stuffed french toast if you really want to indulge. Dinner items are all over the place and while everything is generally tasty, not every item is stellar. I'm a fan of the farm bread appetizers and spicy tuna poke salad. The fried chicken salad was too heavy on the buttermilk dressing to be considered anything more than fried chicken with some extraneous leaves, but I guess that's what you get for ordering a fried chicken salad. The housemade pastas are quite rich (e.g. the chicken bolognese is cream-based) with generous portion sizes. Interesting drink selections too. Overall, a solid and popular option that has something for everyone in an area with relatively sparse pickings. Recommend: farm breads, beignets, bacon, spicy ahi poke salad, bacon, Cucumber Delight drink"
Gretchen T.,"Sacramento, CA",7/20/2017,5.0,"I came here off of a recommendation from my brother to try the chicken and waffles and that is exactly what I did.I got to the restaurant right around 5:00 p.m. on a Tuesday evening and it was packed. The hostess said the wait was between 45 minutes and an hour. Thankfully, there was an empty seat at the bar and was able to sit down right away.I ordered the chicken and waffles and an amber ale beer. I don't recall the name of it, but it was really good.Bonus points for having the San Francisco Giants game on TV. Lol. I'm pretty sure it was the only game going on at the time, but it was still awesome.The chicken and waffles were the perfect size. It was like half of a Belgian waffle with piece of thigh and a piece of breast and sides of macaroni and cheese and green beans. Everything was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. The saltiness of the chicken balanced well with the sweetness of the waffle with syrup. The skin on the chicken was ridiculously crispy. The macaroni and cheese  was great and the green beans were nice and crisp. I hate when restaurants serve mushy green beans like they came from a can. I finished everything on the plate. Would definitely order this again."
Keizzel C.,"East Bay, CA",8/1/2017,5.0,"Any place that has raved about chicken & waffles is always a place I need to check out. We had reservations for 8:30PM and I thought this place wouldn't be too bad since it was later in the night but hoooly moly this place was packed! Luckily my friend made reservations since the wait was 1.5hrs +, but even with reservations we had to wait an additional 15-20mins. AMBIANCE: - This place is crazy! It's packed because it's a great food spot which can also be a con because it gets loud. I'm happy we were seated upstairs since it seemed a bit more mellow and didn't hold the sound as much as the downstairs area did. SERVICE: - Nothing out of the ordinary. Our waitress was friendly and came by often for refills, but nothing too spectacular. I do applaud them for offering the level of service they do because the crowds here are insane and i've been to places that don't handle them well.FOOD: - Chicken & Waffles - Was it worth the hype? Yes it was! This dish does not only include chicken and waffles, but a side of man n cheese, and green beans. The green beans were a little overcooked in my opinion but the mac and cheese was delicious! Pasta cooked al dente and the sauce just cheesy enough but not soupy. They give you 2 pieces of huge chicken perfectly crispy but not oily and pair that with 2 delicious pieces of waffles. I think the waffles in addition to the mac and cheese were my fave! They were light, airy, and ugh so good. I could only finish half, but even as leftovers the meal was worth it. FINAL VERDICT: Is this place over hyped? Based on my experience not at all. I can see why i's a D.C staple and if you're in the area I would recommend coming, but be sure to make reservations or else."
Lauri W.,"Richmond, VA",7/13/2017,5.0,"Looooved Founding Farmers! We came here for a girl's dinner to kick off our weekend in DC and we all were impressed with our food. I love the layout and feel of the restaurant and literally everything on the menu sounded amazing. I'll agree with a couple of the recent reviews and say that the service was ""meh"". Our waiter was nice enough, but he went ghost toward the end of the meal which normally wouldn't have been as much of a problem if we weren't trying to get a cake for an early birthday surprise for one of our friends! Eventually, it was taken care of and all was well. I ordered the crab cake meal that made my tastebuds dance. I already can't wait to go back to Founding Farmers. I just wanna eat my way through the menu!"

Updated review",4.0,"Alright after 2-3 more dining experiences here, I'm updating my review... my first bad experience seems fluke... I'm addicted to their beignets and cocktails... I like the Founding Farmers Breakfast... I like this family of restaurants, though Farmers and Distillers is still my favorite... and I thought the gender neutral bathrooms were interesting ""men, women and the rest of us""... this is just a fun hipster-y place to come get a great breakfast / brunch... can't speak much to their lunch / dinner.Oh and the strawberry mist cocktail is delicious, I finally conquered my fear of it having egg whites in it and ordered it... my only regret is not trying it sooner and wasting all that money on bellinis lol"
Chris C.,"Bayside, NY",8/30/2017,5.0,"I just had meatloaf with mash and spinach, and my fiance had chicken fried steak with some green beans... probably the most basic American brunch meal... but dude idk what they do to the food, they make it taste Anyone who has the money to spend about 25-30$ per person, should experience this brunch lunch and dinner spot in the heart of DC."
Dora H.,"Temple City, CA",7/5/2017,5.0,"Even with the excruciatingly long wait time... it was well worth the wait. If you are on vacation, I highly recommend making reservations to save you some time you could use perusing museums or memorials rather than waiting around in the waiting area. Though if you need a breather after a long day of exploring, by all means enjoy the air conditioning and books they have available!The wait staff do their best to accommodate your needs and make sure you are taken care of. We were offered bacon glazed Lollis which were simply amazing. If you like bacon, or ribs. I highly recommend ordering some for the table! The cornbread skillet was also phenomenal. The bread was moist and the pieces of corn in the bread added nice texture. The butter also had a nice honey drizzle which did not add much to flavor, but looked appealing.Their gnocchi had a nice texture, and they were more than generous with the amount of sausage that accompanied the meal. The meatloaf was also very delicious, integrating the buttery mash potatoes and spinach very well. The waffle was nice and crispy, and the fried chicken was crispy and tender.I enjoyed the food here, and though my dining experience was short, I enjoyed their concept of dining sustainably and would definitely recommend this location to anyone visiting the area!"
Gloria L.,"Philadelphia, PA",9/10/2017,5.0,"I was so so pleasantly surprised by Founding Farmers. It was so delicious!!! It gets so much hype and several people recommended it to me. I didn't have too high of expectations because a lot of times when a restaurant is so hyped, I find it easily lets down my expectations. But Founding Farmers was really, really good!!! I went for brunch with a friend. We both split the beignets and I ordered the pastrami hash. The beignets were absolutely amazing.  I liked the caramel sauce the best! The order came with 5 beignets, which was way more than enough. The pastrami in the hash was probably the best pastrami I've had outside of New York. It was very impressive. I just wish they just put more of it in the dish! I will definitely be coming here again!"
Dominique I.,"Northeast Washington, Washington, DC",8/30/2017,5.0,"Always come here for BREAKFAST! It's the BEST around. Normally come during the week when it is less busy. I wasn't craving so I came in on a Saturday knowing it would be a wait. I called beforehand, the host said it was about a 45 minute wait. I came anyways hoping I could get a seat at the bar. Waited for about 10 minutes and luckily was able to grab at seat at the bar. Luis was the bartender on this day. I have had the Red Velvet Pancake (+++), Chicken & Waffles (+++) , and Whipped Blueberry Butter Pancake (+++). Love me some Hot Tea, especially their Moroccan Mint Tea. I had planned on ordering their Carrot Cake Pancakes, but sadly that discontinued them. I was very shocked to hear that removed the Red Velvet Pancakes off the menu as well.I love Blueberries! So Whipped Blueberry Butter Pancakes it is. The Pancakes come with three large fresh blueberry filled pancake and homemade blueberry butter. I can never eat more than 1 1/2 of my pancakes. I wish the Chicken & Waffles came with either more tenders than three or larger size tenders. If I could I would order just a side of chicken tenders to go with my pancakes. Yup It's that good!"
Marianna C.,"Plymouth Meeting, PA",7/3/2017,5.0,"Omg I am SO happy we were able to come try this place. You need a reservation on most days, and we kept checking open table during the day until one opened up during the time we had hoped to eat. We really lucked out!!Everything here is farm fresh and locally made and it really shows. Everything was delicious! We started off with some freshly popped kettle corn and skillet corn bread. I'm not a huge corn bread fan but omg the kettle corn tasted like it was straight out of a state fair. It was AMAZING. Everyone was able to order something they liked for dinner and there are a lot of different options on the menu.  The prices are overall very reasonable, especially considering that fresh ingredients are used and most things (even the pasta) are homemade. I got the goat cheese ravioli and it was TO DIE FOR! It was covered in a yummy butternut squash sauce and came with some chicken on the side. I loved it! Everyone else loved their dishes as well.  We were also pleased with how accommodating and nice everyone was when we told them of my dads gluten intolerance and my brothers tree nut allergy. Someone from the kitchen came out to speak with us to ensure we would all have a safe and delicious dining experience! That was very kind.Overall I would 100% return here and recommend it to anyone. I'm so excited for them to open up their restaurant in King of Prussia so I can come moreOften!"
Kevin M.,"Philadelphia, PA",8/21/2017,5.0,"I had one of the best meals of my life here a few months ago. That is not an exaggeration; it was maybe the best meal I have had in the US in years. My group was about 12 and had reservations made months in advance knowing that it would be impossible to get a group of that size in here on a Sunday night. The ambiance is beautiful, modern, clean. The lighting was dark, yet they had great table focused lighting so that you felt like you were dining with just your party. I really liked that. The staff were absolutely amazing; attentive, funny, personable, knowledgeable, and easy to chat with. I really enjoyed the way that they worked fluidly together and always seemed to be on the same page with the rest of the wait staff.For drinks, they have an inventive menu of craft and specialty cocktails, alongside a diverse menu of beers and wines. I enjoyed the ""La Paloma"" and had them make me a personal cocktail for my second drink, also with tequila and with a nice spicy finish. The staff clearly cared about what I enjoyed and created an experience through the drinks they served.For food we had a lot, like a lot, of food. We shared the devilish eggs, jonny's BBQ spiced nuts, fried green tomatoes (!!), and glazed bacon lollis (!!). The devil-ish eggs and the spiced nuts were great, but weren't anything super special. However, those tomatoes and bacon lollis. Oh myyy goodness. The fried tomatoes were smooth, full of favor, and were clearly fresh and local. The bacon lollis were exactly what you'd expect. What could possible be wrong with bacon, served in lollipop form? Absolutely nothing.For dinner, I shared with a friend and we ordered the chicken and waffles and the braised short rib. Both were amazing! The pieces of chicken were meaty and salty like you'd want, and the waffles were light and fluffy. The short ribs were fall off the bone smooth, and those mashed potatoes were really delicious. We had about 10 other entries spread across the group, and all of them were really delicious. Finally, we shared a few orders of beignets. These were the best beignets I have ever had. Ever. They are a must order if you are ever have the chance to dine at Founding Farmers. I will definitely be back, and more importantly I am SOOO excited that they are opening a location in King of Prussia, outside of Philadelphia so I an indulge whenever I choose."
Cindy W.,"San Diego, CA",9/10/2017,4.0,"Prior to visiting D.C., I did some research on the best restaurants to visit and Founding Farmers was on the top of the list. We called ahead and made reservations to beat the morning crowds and good thing we did!  When we arrived at the restaurant, it was already filling up. We were seated upstairs and service was prompt. We ordered fresh squeezed OJ, fresh brewed coffee and a couple of breakfast entrees (potato hash with eggs, and eggs benedict). The portions were just the right amount and the prices were fair. I would recommend this restaurant to other people visiting the D.C. area."
Tramaine W.,"Lithonia, GA",8/27/2017,4.0,"This place had a line of 30+ people before it opened at 8:30 on Sunday. Keep this in mind. I had the chicken and waffles which was good. Also had scrambled cheese eggs. I would say everything was good and the establishment is one to visit. I wasn't blown away but it's still a good place to try in DC to form your own opinion and see what the hype is. I also enjoyed my breakfast at ""a baked joint"" so don't miss that. Must try the breakfast Sammie it's something special."
Jean Claire G.,"Queens, NY",6/21/2017,4.0,"I'm glad I listen to my friend who recommend me to this place. To get a table you have to make reservation. Theirs  a lot of people when we got there on a sunday afternoon and waited 10 minutes before we got seated for brunch. The place is huge with a second floor. We got seated upstairs in a booth. Food: we got their beignets $8- raspberry, chocolate & caramel sauce. Freshly made & still hot when served. We love each bite especially with the sauce. My bf got chicken & waffle- not from the breakfast menu, its their dinner menu, it comes with mac & cheese & beans on the side. He enjoyed it. I tried a little piece of the chicken & it was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. My sister & I got a semilar breakfast meal I got the crab benedict with grits on the side & she got the traditional ham benedict with fruits on the side- both are so tasty that we finished everything! Good hollandaise sauce! For drink I tried their grapefruit soda- big glass of fruity soda. Refreshing!Great place to go when in DC!"
Anna C.,"Homestead, FL",6/20/2017,4.0,"We started thinking about dinner around 4p.m., and my significant other started looking on yelp for restaurants close to our hotel. All of a sudden I hear, ""Wow!, have you ever seen over 8,000 reviews on a business?"". As a matter of fact, I have seen over 10,000 reviews on one business. And that in itself enticed me to visit Founding Farmers - D.C.I get on my phone and check out this place. Within minutes I am logging into OpenTable to make a reservation for three people for 5:15p.m. We decided to start walking from our hotel room a few minutes earlier to walk leisurely and enjoy the city. We ended up arriving at the restaurant at 5p.m., and checking in with the hostess. She said it would be a few minutes, but would try to seat us earlier if she could. We ended up waiting almost 20 minutes. No an issue as the time flew by quickly with conversation. I highly recommend making reservations, as the restaurant was packed at 5p.m. on a rainy day. The host greeted us with a friendly smile, and we followed him upstairs to our booth.Our waitress took a few more minutes to show up than what I was expecting. However, she was nice as she apologized that her section was moved. We ordered water with lemon first, and it was brought out quickly. We then ordered adult beverages; I ordered the ""El Presidente"" $9, and the ""Farmer Jon"" $12. I enjoyed the El Presidente as it was a bit sweet, but light. My significant other enjoy Farmer Jon, but wished it wasn't overwhelmed with the sugar on the rim. The sugar was drizzling on the sides, and made it difficult to hold the glass. Plus, our waitress did not think to place a napkin or coaster under the drink, and it almost fell off the table by sliding off.I ordered the avocado bacon burger (medium) with honey scotch carrots and pearl onions $13. The burger was done as I requested, the bacon flavorable and crisp, the avocado fresh and plenty of it. The honey scotch carrots were cooked to perfection with a hint of tart and sweetness to them. My better half ordered the chicken and waffles with mac & cheese and green beans $16. I tried the dish, and the chicken was juicy and tender, the waffles crisp and buttery, the green beans crunchy and well seasoned, and the mac n' cheese light but cheesy. We were both happy with our entrees. Kudos to the chef!Overall, this yelper gives 4 stars to Founding Farmers - D.C., for excellent flavor in food, comfortable yet stylish ambience, and good service.Thank you. Should I be in this area again, I will be making reservations."
Charishma N.,"USF, Tampa Bay, FL",8/31/2017,4.0,"We were lucky that Sunday afternoon, our timing couldn't be more perfect we walked in right after a few parties left and we were given a table right away. No wait time(Yay!)I ordered Chicken Bolognese Bucatini. It was delicious. The pasta was soft and chewy, the sauce was rich. I'd highly recommend to try this dish!"
Jessica V.,"Houston, TX",6/28/2017,5.0,"Y'all- these reviews don't lie and the 45 minute wait was totally worth it. I definitely recommend setting an reservation a day or two in advance, for even for breakfast/lunch on a weekday. The staff was incredibly nice despite how busy the waiting area was- literally standing room only. Also major kudos to our waiter for getting our food order in quickly because we were given our food just 10 minutes after placing our order. Food: I absoluuuutely loved my lobster mac & chz - unlike a lot of other restaurants that serve this dish, there were two large pieces of lobster meat instead of little shredded pieces. However, if I were to return, I would definitely be ordering the chicken and waffles. The chicken was SO good!"
Zoë G.,"Newark, DE",8/20/2017,5.0,"Loved the atmosphere, loved the food, and loved he service. All aspects were on par here. I loved the brunch because it was no frills, classic items. Everything was pretty simple, but not simple in taste and flavors. Everything seasoned perfectly, and absolutely delicious. One recommendation is to make sure you make a reservation. Luckily, we did. But when we got there it was an hour wait! Overall, recommend! Place lives up to the hype."

Updated review",5.0,"Yes! Best breakfast we had in D.C.  Had to sit at the bar because we didn't have a reservation, but we were happy to get seated somewhere. Got the crab Benedict and it ruled. Lots of crab. The French press coffee was good and strong. Get a reservation if you want a tableCame here multiple times on yet another D.C. work trip and everything rules here. Great service."
Anthea W.,"San Diego, CA",6/17/2017,4.0,"We enjoyed the restaurant so much that we came twice during our week long trip. Dinner - i had reservations, but we still ended up waiting 10 mins for our table. It's super busy here! I HIGHLY recommend you make reservations!We started off with the famous apps, cornbread and the wings. The cornbread is heavenly! I usually don't like actual bits of corn in it, but it added so much sweetness. The butter and salted honey complements the bread very well. The wings were yummy too, a bit on the salty side, but I ended up eating more than I said I would.I was pretty full after the apps, so I don't think it's fair to the rest of the food. I ordered the yankee pot roast and hubby got the chicken and waffles. Although the pot roast was tender, it's nothing special. The chicken and waffles were pretty good, the waffles were surprisingly fluffy. I didn't enjoy the chicken so much. Brunch - no reservations, but found a seat at the bar. Not too busy for a Friday thank goodness. I ordered the stuffed french toast with bananas. SO GOOD. It's alot of cream on the inside. I dont think a normal person would be able to finish all 3 pieces so def share this! Hubby got the crab eggs benedicts, which was alright. As crazy as the wait is for some people, this place definitely lives up to its reputation."
Tyneisha M.,"Philadelphia, PA",6/16/2017,3.0,"This was my first time at this location and I enjoyed the decor and my meal but service was lacking which I did not expect with all the great reviews. We had to wait about 20 minutes in a crowded lobby with others walking by us for our table of 3 to be seated when we had a reservation. To me that is unacceptable, I feel that with a reservation you should wait no more than 10 minutes, especially when there is not adequate waiting area seating. Our server was also preoccupied and seemed annoyed by our menu questions. I opted for the fried chicken and waffles which was very good. My waffles were a bit cold but edible. Overall I'd give this place another shot but service needs to improve."
Elle J.,"Fort Washington, MD",8/16/2017,4.0,"I first heard of Founding Farmers from an article stating that this particular DC staple was overrated. After visiting i'd have to say that their establishment is worthy of a high rating.We walked in a little after 2pm without a reservation. Though we opted for the bar, the wait wasn't incredibly long.My friend and another diner ordered the Goat Cheese Ravioli which they both agreed was absolutely delicious. I had the Chicken and Waffles with Mac and Cheese and Green Beans. I've usually had chicken and waffles as a sweet and savory and dish, but this took the savory approach. The chicken was nice, juicy and crispy. Mac and Cheese flavorful and the waffles complemented the dish well. It came with a gravy sauce on the side but everything worked together so well, it was fine without.I can't say the cornbread was a favorite but adding to the overall feel of the restaurant it was still fresh and had fresh corn baked into it. One thing that threw me for a loop is that by habit, i usually order a soda such as sprite, but they don't serve soda. They actually mixed together ingredients to simulate the taste of soda instead. It was actually quite delicious and refreshing. Overall, i enjoyed my time at Founding Farmers, i would definitely go again to try more of their menu."
Bernie G.,"Calgary, Canada",6/30/2017,5.0,"Wow. It's no surprise this place gets so many reviews. We stopped here for breakfast on a Thursday morning and it was packed. Despite being busy, our service was prompt and professional.There were four of us and 3 dishes deserved a great rating. The fourth dish, stuffed french toast, was very good but just slightly less interesting than the other three. My Beet and Goat Cheese Hash was fantastic. The ingredients were very well balanced with nothing over powering (which goat cheese can be). The coffee was fresh but could have been hotter. The bread is all home made at their sister restaurant.  Overall very good value for your dollar and certainly worth another visit. We looking forward to trying their sister restaurant, Farmers, Fishers and Bakers in Georgetown."
Joseph M.,"Troy, MI",9/12/2017,2.0,"This was not a pleasant experience. The food in my opinion was not good but keep in my mind this was just one experience. I want to be helpful in this update since I was contacted due to my bad review so I'll try to explain: 1. It tasted like the quality of the meat or the prep process left a fatty unpleasantness on the palate. My platter had 2 mini burgers, ribs, to name a few things. 2. The quality of the items we were served along with how they were presented did not reflect the atmosphere or the pricing of the restaurant.  3. On a positive note, this establishment had a nice atmosphere, clean, and had a very friendly and helpful staff. The food made me feel like I was at a Chile's or Friday's. Hope this helps clear up my earlier negative review."
Krysten D.,"Baldwin, NY",8/17/2017,2.0,"I wish so badly that I could have given Founding Farmers the review that it seemed it deserves. I even waited to write the review to see if my opinions would lighten up, but they haven't and to say I was disappointed was an understatement. Founding Farmers' venue was truly great. Trendy and hipster without being too pretentious. I had been dying to eat here during my vacation due to the great reviews, but unfortunately, after  our mediocre experience, I think that Yelp may have steered me wrong. Here's the breakdown:Service- Our waitress was really sweet but neglected us several times throughout our meal. I'm not sure if you have to ask, but everyone at the restaurant had massive jars of water on their table except us. Then when our glasses of water were empty, she took over 20 minutes to fill them. I hate nitpicking but it's extremely aggravating to be thirsty, see everyone with drinks at their table and not be able to get your waitress's attention.  To be fair, it was lunch time and probably extremely busy at the restaurant but I could not help but feel that she was more attentive to the business lunch happening next to us (who arrived at the same exact time as us). Food: As my boyfriend kindly put it, maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but I am assuming if something is listed as a staple then it is one of your best meals, Right? Point blank do NOT order the shrimp and grits. It's more like a grits soup. My grits were extremely clumpy, and the sauce tasted off.Had the shrimp not been perfectly cooked, I would have returned the dish. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles, another staple. His chicken was mostly bone but what was meat was very moist.  The mac and cheese that comes as a side to the chicken and waffles was more like water and melted cheese with pasta. As the potus would say, SAD. The highlight of our meal was the mini sliders- they came with a house sauce and fries that were AMAZING and the only reason this review is not one star. I'm not one to right negative reviews but I couldn't let this one slide. I still think about the shrimp and grits I had at Founding Farmers and cringe.Yelp rarely steers me wrong butI was so disappointed with my experience I couldn't let it go. Do not let my review steer you away from this restaurant. I wanted to share my experience, however with such a high rating, I'm hoping I was an outlier."
Edwin P.,"Hialeah, FL",6/5/2017,5.0,"As my girlfriend and I were planning our first trip together, we checked out different restaurants in the DC area through yelp and word of mouth. A lot of my classmates kept raving about Founding Farmers for breakfast/brunch. I looked it up on Yelp and saw the reviews and immediately was sold. With that, I made reservations for breakfast at 9:00 am as I had read it gets filled up pretty quickly.Founding Farmers has several locations in the DC area and also one in the Philadelphia suburbs. They are all owned by 47,000 family farmers and specialize in farm to table concept.This location is on Pennsylvania Avenue, in the ""Foggy Bottom"" district of DC, right down the road from the World Bank and the IMF. Once we arrived right before 9:00 am I realized I made the right decision in reserving ahead of time as the wait time was almost an hour. With our prior reservations already set, we were immediately seated upstairs and were promptly provided with water to start as well as the menu (which is made from leather brought from Texas)Prior to coming, I had checked the menu just to see what they offered and with that idea in mind, I went ahead and ordered the sausage, mushroom & spinach pan scramble with a side of thick cut bacon glazed in black pepper male, while my girlfriend ordered the roasted vegetable pan scramble.While waiting for our orders, we gazed around the restaurant and noticed how rustic the concept is, which makes sense as this is a farm to table concept. I loved it and admired the wood logs and trees around; it made you feel like you were on a farm.Soon we received our food and let me tell you. After eating that bacon, i want to get thick cut from now on. The crunch with the mix of pepper and maple glaze was every heavenly and iI devoured those bacons as if there were no tomorrow. But i digress; the pan scramble was amazing as well. The pork sausage was very thick, and not the skinny types of sausages your normally used to. The mix of the sausages with the vegetables and eggs was a cornucopia of tastes in my mouth, with the mix of the salty meat, and the taste of the vegetables with the crunchiness.Definitely will come back next time I'm in DC, but for dinner. Definitely recommended."
Eric S.,"Oak Park, IL",6/2/2017,5.0,"FOUR SCORE (& SEVEN BEERS AGO)""....our fathers brought forth to this city a new restaurant, conceived in quality, and dedicated to the proposition that all diners are created equal.""My Yelp journey through the nation's capital ends with this, my 28th posting in 28 days (holy crap!)  I saved this one until the end, not because there was so much to think about -- honestly the 5* decision was a no-brainer -- but rather because I felt like waiting to post the best for last.Yelp fact: this is the 8,808th review for Founding Farmers which puts them at fourth-most......in the world.  As in, there are only *3* businesses on the planet with more Yelp reviews than FF (Cafe du Monde, Phil's BBQ, Bottega Louie).  Whether for lunch, brunch, or dinner, this is one of the hottest restaurants in the USA and there was ZERO chance I'd skip out on an opportunity to eat here.Having made a reservation well in advance (I highly recommend you do this), I sauntered in shortly after 11am on a Thursday in early May and was seated upstairs with very little delay.  The atmosphere was positively bustling with Georgetown students and government officials, many of whom were dressed to the nines.After a surprisingly long delay, I finally got attention from my server and put in a drink order.  I also got an order of their classic deviled eggs ($5) which honestly weren't all that great.  Their skillet cornbread with sea salt butter is allegedly very good, since I saw most tables of 3+ people scarfing it down.Knowing I only had one shot at a signature entrée, I dared for something different than the usual, despite the rave reviews I'd heard about their blue cheese balsamic bacon burger.  Instead, I got their chicken & waffles ($16) which turned out to be the best decision I'd make all trip.Folks, the chicken + waffles here is one for the record books.  The waffle itself comes in a half portion on the side and isn't all that remarkable.  However, this dish also comes with two sides: 'al dente' green beans and their seven cheese macaroni that is just out of this world.  On its own, the mac 'n' cheese was some of the best my palate has ever come across.And then there was the fried chicken.  OH THE CHICKEN.  Battered, perfectly crispy, lightly salted and peppered, yet still succulent and juicy on the inside.  Hands down the best fried chicken dish I've ever had.  Combine this with the cheesy mac and a $16 menu selection becomes a legendary meal that I'll reminisce on for years to come.Bread = 5+Circuses = 4There were some lapses in service, although that's likely because I was dining alone and sitting next to a partition which made me all but invisible.*TL;DR*Ben Franklin and his insatiable appetite would approve.  I'm confident that 98% of stuff on the FF menu are home runs (the chicken & waffles was a walk-off, game-winning grand slam).  Their food is sustainable, delicious, served in ample quantities, and original!  I'm very happy I came here and look forward to returning again in the future.What's above ""highly recommend""?  Does such a category exist?  Founding Farmers is truly in a league of their own when it comes to American farm-to-table fare."
Caroline B.,"Sandia Heights South, Albuquerque, NM",9/1/2017,5.0,"This is a review for Sunday brunch!------ TL;DR Bustling D.C. brunch place serving classic brunch dishes prepared well with local ingredients. Friendly service. Large menu good for large parties.+FOOD+-    Chicken and Waffles (4.5 stars): Soft, fluffy waffle + perfectly cooked fried chicken = happiness. I appreciated that the waffle was not too sweet so I could douse it in that wonderful cinnamon infused maple syrup FF offers. I was also able to substitute the two eggs for a side farmer's salad, which I was grateful for. The waffle did not have a crisp exterior, a feature I normally require of my waffles, however, that did not bother me this time around. This chicken and waffles is probably not the best chicken and waffles you will ever have, however it is prepared well and you will be very satisfied eating it. -    Butternut Squash Marscapone Ravioli (4.5 stars): Wonderful smooth butternut squash flavor complimented by delicate flavors of sage. Rich but not so rich that you can't finish the plate. +EXPERIENCE+I made a Sunday reservation for 11:15 am on Open Table two days in advance for a party of 10. Alas, the day of my party shrunk to 7 and arrived 20 minutes late. I was really worried about losing our reservation, however the hostess was very understanding and updated my reservation as I updated her the status of my party. Our waiter was super friendly and took the time to get to know us! He asked us where everyone in the party was from and made more conversation even after that. His friendliness was refreshing. Our food took about 15 minutes to arrive. Everyone was satisfied with their food and the bill was split into individual checks without a problem. The restaurant is kind of noisy given the sizable brunch crowd, but you can still hear your tablemates. I think the dishes are priced reasonably given the locally-sourced ingredients and quality of food. 5 stars for the combination of good food and great, friendly service. I would return here again. Visited 8/27/17"
Victor L.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/10/2017,2.0,"As one of the most reviewed restaurants in all of yelp I was expecting so much more. I went to Washington DC on a trip and the one thing I had to do was come here. What I got was an almost 2 hour wait for less than stellar food.Fried Green Tomatoes (3/5) - One of the most popular dishes. I thought they were just okay. The tomatoes were fresh, but the fried batter was very thick and heavy. I ate one and I just didn't have the appetite for more.Fried Chicken (2/5) - Dry breast meatRotisserie Chicken (2/5) - Even more dry breast meatChicken Pot Pie (1/5) - Probably the worst pot pie I have ever had in my life. Instead of a light puff pastry covering my pot pie I get a chunk of bread just sitting on top. I couldn't even dip the bread because the creamy sauce you would expect from a pot pie was almost non existent. The chicken was also dry... again. On top of that the whole thing was under seasoned. Lock up the person who ruined chicken pot pie and throw away the key.Founding Farmers is not worth the wait or the price. It blows my mind that it has such a high yelp rating with that many reviews. Did I miss something? What do people see in this place that I don't? Maybe avoid all chicken dishes... or maybe people here like dry chicken. The world may never know..."
Alexis G.,"Burlingame, CA",9/10/2017,5.0,Just go! More than 9000 reviews with a high rating mean something! Came here for dinner with the BF! It's reasonably priced. Get the chicken and waffles :) You can thank me later - I even went the next morning again lol
O C.,"Placentia, CA",9/8/2017,3.0,Hubby and I had lunch here. It was recommended by a friend. We really like it and my favorite were the Bacon Blue Cheese Dates. Hubby had Gnocchi and loved that!The restaurant is large and I do recommend making reservations because it's very busy. It was difficult to have a conversation though without having to talk loudly.  The service was very good and I give that five stars.
Ules D.,"Milford, CT",8/19/2017,5.0,Food=5Drinks=5Service=5On a Saturday night the wait was short so we had a drink at the bar. The shrimp and grits were reminiscent of mine in Charleston South Carolina. Amazing. He had the Farmers platter and it's a lot of food that is amazing and he devoured it. Everything was perfect.
Rona S.,"Seattle, WA",9/7/2017,4.0,"This place is almost impossible to make reservations at. However it's well worth it. They have a wide selection for breakfast and open early for it. They also have a expansive menu for lunch and dinner. But beware, it is usually crowded, especially since it's so close to multilateral organizations. Make a reservation ahead of time and take out of town friends to enjoy some farm to table."
Marilu F.,"Hialeah, FL",6/6/2017,5.0,"The farm to table concept has really taken off, and on our visit to D.C., my boyfriend and I had heard so much about this place that we just had to visit. Healthy, fresh, and with great reviews, boyfriend set up a reservation for 9 AM one Sunday morning and thank goodness he did. The place was packed, and well, that was despite the rain.Our reservation in order, we were led to the second floor of this locale. Once there, we were attended graciously and quickly by our waitress. It is probably a good thing that we already more or less knew what we were going to order because this place was quite busy, so the rush is felt when you see the employees buzzing about. I would say it almost seems pushy except that they are ridiculously nice about it all.Anyway, boyfriend ordered an orange juice and I ordered a cappuccino. Both were decent. I say decent because I am not used to drinking something so easy to swallow. Perhaps that sounds odd, but the drinks themselves leave themselves to be tasted. They are quite refreshing. In terms of food, we both ordered pan scrambles. My boyfriend's pan scramble consisted of sausage, mushroom, and spinach, with potatoes and toast as sides, while mine was the roasted vegetable pan scramble which had onions, carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, and spinach, with potatoes and toast as sides. Note that my boyfriend also ordered a side of bacon. While I cannot comment on his food, I can definitely comment on mine, and well, let's just say this is changing my opinion on what I should be eating. Food that is good for you is actually tasty.I know, I know, that may be not be a secret, but when you think about it, going out to eat, you do not really do the farm to table concept. You actually have no idea where the food is coming from. To know where it is coming from, to eat it and consider it yummy, it certainly puts a few things into perspective. Oh, and the best thing about it all is that the food actually fills you. I could barely finish my plate."

Updated review",4.0,"Okay, this is my second opportunity come to this place. The eggs were still delicious but I did put some salt pepper on them they seem to taste a lot better; not that it needed some pepper but boy it made it that much more delicious. I had the mushroom Meurnier and Risotto. The other picture is of the Sampler Platter and of the Turkey Sandwich on the menu.For the mushroom dish, you really have to like garlic because it's really a good pungent buttery garlic taste. I loved it. The other individual with me had the Sampler Platter and he really enjoyed each piece of it, it was very large portions so lot of that went home for lunch tomorrow (the chips came cold to the table...meh). The other individual that was sitting with us had the Fish & Chips, and I don't think he really enjoyed it. I would say this is probably not the place for Fish & Chips; find another location in DC for that (Jimmies Famous Seaford?).As you know there been featured on FoodTV for their Chicken & Waffles but none of us tried that this time; although I did try it last time (I prefer boneless with my waffles, here they have bone-in). Overall, most of us that had the vegetarian dishes really enjoy them, the other people were not as happy with the meal. I have to mention the carrot cake because I was very excited to enjoy a piece of good carrot; this was not it. The carrot cake consistency was very spongy and wet. Plus, I like a little bit of a lemon taste in my carrot cake and this was just not very good. The cake versus ratio to frosting, left a little bit to be desired. I think I like a little firmer of a cake and this was just really spongy and moist. Not moist in a good way either.  Skip the carrot cake, enjoy something else like maybe the Beignets."
Kelly T.,"Farmington, CT",8/16/2017,5.0,"Founding Farmers is excellent. They were very accommodating when I added an extra person to my reservation on the day of, and we ended up being seated at the table used by Michelle Obama!Having been to Founding Farmers several times, I would say that my favorite drink option is the bar tender's choice. Basically, you pick the type of liquor and characteristics that you enjoy (fruity, sweet, etc.) and they make you a custom drink! I got a blueberry gin drink from my instructions and it was excellent!For appetizers, I ordered the farm bread with apple, Brie, and onion marmalade. It was excellent - the bread was served warm and the toppings all complemented one another nicely. For my entree, I ordered the butternut squash marscapone ravioli. This was INCREDIBLE. While the plate initially looked rather small, the ravioli were very rich and smothered in a butter sage sauce. I am not vegetarian, but this was a wonderful vegetarian entree for anyone interested!For dessert, I ordered the beignets. They did take an additional 30 minutes to prepare because they are served fresh, but the wait was well worth it. The beignets were very hot and not oily, but also moist. There was a lot of powdered sugar as well, so be careful if you're wearing black!Overall, this is an excellent choice for a nice dinner out in DC, but due to it's popularity you should try to make a reservation about a week in advance!"
Andie Hojun L.,"Fells Point, Baltimore, MD",8/15/2017,4.0,"This place lined up quick close to opening time on a Saturday morning so get there quick or make reservations. Great location for brunch. I got the crab eggs benefict, which was great. I wish it had a little more crab meat though but I still enjoyed it. THEIR HASHBROWNS are to die for. You have to get it. Their house coffee is also excellent. My husband got their steak and eggs, which was great also. Street parking is free on the weekends so we parked right up front."
Alka M.,"Berkeley, CA",8/15/2017,5.0,"Make a reservation as this place gets so busy! The beet and goat cheese poached eggs dish was so amazing, I was talking about it for hours after brunch. Tried the beignets as well as everyone seemed to be getting them, and they were great. Free top-offs for regular coffee too. only thing was that the fork I had was dirty when I unwrapped it...kinda gross. the waitresses promptly switched it out when I told her."
Sylvia P.,"Las Cruces, NM",9/5/2017,5.0,"Nice! A reservation was a bonus idea! Food was great, service, and coffee was yummy! Had the original pancakes added eggs on side. Shareable, portions are huge. Enjoy!"
Zahydie B.,"Orlando, FL",8/1/2017,5.0,"I love this restaurant. The menu is varied and caters to every taste and vegetarians. They are a made-from-scratch family owned restaurant, and the servers are always kind and serviceable. I've had their chicken and waffles, lobster mac and cheese, cheeseburger and meat loaf (among others)...and they were all so yummy! I can't decide for a favorite since I've never had anything that I didn't like. Even their sodas are made from scratch, so don't expect to be served Coca-Cola or Pepsi-like products. They have a full bar, and an infinite selection of drinks. This place is so popular that you must make a reservation . It is a vibrant place, so if you are looking for something quiet or intimate, maybe you should look for a different restaurant. However, I do love the ambiance and how full of life it is, so I don't mind the people laughing over loud conversations"
Kelly N.,"Miami, FL",7/29/2017,5.0,"Yes, yes and yes! This place is all it's cracked up to be. I have been visiting D.C. quite a few times now over the span of my life, and I have yet to go to Founding Farmers to brunch. That's all I've ever heard about, and the opportunity finally arose for me recently.We had prior reservations for a group of 10, which was the smart thing to do since this place gets PACKED. Lucky for us, we went on a Friday, so we didn't have to battle it out with the typical weekend crowd. But nonetheless, it was still busy and all tables were full for a Friday at 10:30a. I was definitely impressed off the start.Immediately our server came to take drink orders. I was hoping there was bottomless mimosa (or bottomless anything, really), but there was not; and probably for the best. I would imagine if they had that offering people would never leave. I went with a good ol' American coffee instead and it came in a cute, large cappuccino-sized mug with a small, cute tin creamer. I took note of the decor and definitely appreciated the details. As for my meal, I went with the chicken and waffles. That seems to be one of their more popular dishes, and I definitely was not let down. Not only do you get chicken and waffles, but it comes with a side of eggs. It was the perfect combination of salty and sweet. I would definitely go back and order the exact same thing. Some other notable dishes that were ordered at the table included: pan scrambles and the carrot cake pancakes. Both dishes were equally as exceptional. If you like carrot cake, you MUST get the pancakes. They tasted like the real deal, although I'm much more of a savory person so I wouldn't be able to eat it as a meal by itself.This place definitely gets 5 stars for the fresh food, great service, cozy decor, and best of all, affordable prices. I expected a farm to table restaurant with this much hype and beautiful ambiance to be WAY more expensive than it was. The prices were just a small step above of an iHop or local diner. Two thumbs up for keeping it cost affordable. Usually places that are hyped of this much tend to let me down, but this was not the case this time around. I'll definitely make it a point to pay a visit next time I'm in the area."
Leslie T.,"Philadelphia, PA",5/27/2017,5.0,"Was recommended to come here by a friend who went to GW and it was definitely a great choice! We made a reservation for 3 at 12:30 on a Saturday which I would highly recommend to do because the wait without a reservation was 1 hour. After checking in, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes which was kind of disappointing but they quickly made up for it with their fast food service!We looked at the menu while we waited so when we were seated, we ordered right away. Everything looked decent but all 3 of us were especially drawn to the sausage and gravy eggs benedict.... so we all ordered the same thing haha. And a starter size maple cinnamon stuffed French toast to share. I'm usually against ordering the same thing as other people at the table because I want to try multiple menu items... but we couldn't resist!  The stuffed French toast came out 5 minutes after the waitress left. So impressive! The syrup had a sweet honey infused with it and was a great mix with the stuffed French toast. Eggs benedict were all cooked perfectly and the leek hash browns were delicious. Couldn't see a lot of leek in mine personally, but definitely tasted it! Interior was so classy yet casual, they sat us in a booth that could fit 4-5 people and it was great cuz it's always awkward when 1 person has to sit across from nobody on a 4-person seated table. Bathrooms were on point -- single restrooms with nice stone slab sinks  Loved the vibe, fresh food, service, and price. Would recommend to everyone who's looking for a farm to table affordable brunch place in DC!"
Iona C.,"Orinda, CA",5/17/2017,3.0,"I missed the window for brunch (and the red velvet goodness), but lunch was not bad.  I opted for the Founding Farmers Cheeseburger with a macaroni and cheese side ($13) - solid burger and bun, reallyyy good macaroni and cheese.  My friend, Jacque C., got the vegetable bacon bucatini (hold the bacon) - $15 - also really good.  Both the mac and cheese and vegetable bucatini dishes had cream-based sauces, but they were by no means too thick or heavy.  The place was packed when we arrived a little after noon, and plenty of people were standing and waiting, but they must have been larger parties.  Jacque and I waited only a few minutes before we found two seats at the edge of a long table.  If communal dining isn't really your thing, don't worry, there are other separate tables scattered throughout.  Not a bad place for lunch/dinner, but I definitely want to make sure to try brunch next time."
Lyn D.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/13/2017,4.0,"A friend recommended Founding Farmers for brunch, so that's what we did!Jumped in an Uber and arrived to a well packed place. That's usually a good sign so I was intrigued. We placed our name with the hostess who told us it's an 1 hour wait...he also said if we decided to get a seat at the bar just let him know. We stalked out the bar for about 10m and scored 2 seats! I ordered Moroccan Mint tea to start and HB got a Bloody Mary. As I sipped my tea lol, we decided on our meals. I got French toast with egg whites w/ broccoli + spinach. I really enjoyed the French toast! The egg whites are way too SALTY for my liking. The chef or whoever is cooking the eggs should not add salt and leave that up to the patron. HB ordered Vegetable Scrambles and that too was way too salty! Anyway, as we chatted with the bartender, I was noticing a raspberry color drink that seemed very popular and decided to get it. It was Strawberry Fiz -- SO DELICIOUS!!!! HB also order a screwdriver, which I tasted and that too was pretty good! Another couple sat next to us and ordered the Banana Fost pancakes and they said that was a hit, so because HB didn't enjoy his first meal, and he originally came for the pancakes, we ordered a second round of Strawberry Fiz with the pancakes to go :-). On our way back to NY, the pancakes were a hit!  I'd definite return to Founding Farmers. Pleasant staff, great food, and cool vibes on a Sunday....just the way I like it!!!!"
Naomi H.,"Sandy Springs, GA",5/31/2017,4.0,"We dined for one of our date nights here while visiting DC. We made reservations on Opentable - no issues being seated! The place was PACKED!Service was WONDERFUL. We did sit close to the bar and the bartender was not happy...I mean AT ALL, but our server was very nice, informative and as attentive as one could be with the place being so packed.We had the bleu cheese dates, sampler and gnocchi. All were very good. Their cocktails were extremely balanced and the two we had were out of this world."
Chris D.,"Washington, DC",7/28/2017,3.0,"Founding Farmers was fine, but it didn't live up to the hype or my expectations. Service was mixed - the water was friendly and the food came out quickly, but the coffee took a while and the busboy and hostess were rude.The food was good, but nothing I'm craving to have again. The latte was one of the more mediocre lattes I've had in my life. The coffee was not good. The banana foster stuffed french toast was pretty good; it's hard not for it to be seeing as it's stuffed with sugar and covered in bananas. Very sweet, and I liked the cream filling, although it's a lot of one thing. The strawberry waffles surprised me. They were very light and fluffy, and I would have preferred those to the french toast. The final dish, the regular bacon and eggs breakfast, was perfectly average.Many other places to try before I come back here."
Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/1/2017,4.0,"Coming on a Monday afternoon, there were still many people waiting as well as eating there. This place is spacious yet being at where it is at, seems to be always bustling with people. Thankfully, as per my friend's suggestion, I made a reservation and was seated a little earlier than my reservation time (I like to arrive early if I can!). The waitstaff was quick and courteous; bringing our water and menus as well as taking our orders and making recommendations. Unfortunately, not being a fan of mac and cheese in general, I did not get the waitress' recommendation.Let's move on to our food! I loved the bread chips and dip. They had four different dips with a big bowl of chips, bread and something that tasted like a cracker. And it was a very big bowl of chips for our dip. I believe I was a big fan of their romesco, green goddess and onion dip. Their fourth one, which was pimento cheese was okay but overall, this satisfied my carb cravings for some chips. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits in which he liked. However, his side order of spinach was a huge let down. It looked like a sad plate of wilted greens that still looked oily. According to my boyfriend, it was unevenly cooked, presentation wasn't great for the price and a bit on the salty side. So highly recommend to NOT order that side dish (unless they do a better job?). I had the rotisserie chicken which I liked. The waitress also said if you didn't want the two sides that came with it, you can swap with any of the ones on the bottom. I had a side order of the potatoes (it was good) and the cabbage, kale and pear (the pear made it slightly sweet which I liked). Overall, I liked our experience here and would love to come back to order something else I have yet to try here."
Rebekah W.,"Raleigh, NC",5/31/2017,5.0,So glad I had the opportunity to eat here while visiting DC! We tried to make reservations for dinner but they were full so we tried breakfast. Still couldn't get a reservation but we got there when it opened. First we tried the Beignets which were amazing! Must try! So fluffy and decadent. I got the Eggs Benedict as my entree and my husband got the stuffed french toast with strawberries and creme. We both loved our dishes although my english muffin was very hard to cut even with a serrated knife. Even their iced sweet tea was ordered from the bar and hand made. It tasted different but in a great way. Service was excellent and food came out quickly. You can tell they take pride in their food and ingredients and it shows! Excellent restaurant overall.
Melanie C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",9/15/2017,5.0,"I've been to founding farmers twice and my husband always says here when he is in DC. Everything in the menu is delicious. For starters i've has the fried green tomatoes, spiced nuts, deviled eggs and the assorted bread basket. The fried green tomatoes are a must. I've never had anything like it. It is fried perfectly and come with a really good dipping sauce. The deviled eggs are yummy too since it comes with an assortment of deviled eggs. My husband really enjoys the bread basket because it comes with this really good cheesy bread, potato chips, grilled bread, and 4 types of spread for the bread. It is carb heaven and the spreads are all really tasty.During my most recent visit to founding farmers I had the veggie mushroom loaf. It comes with broccolini and mash potatoes. The loaf is flavored really well and it is packed with lentils, carrots, and mushrooms. The is very filling and the sides it comes with are delicious. I've also had the shrimp grits and that is extremely good. The grits is so savory and it comes with enormous shrimps and large chunks of andouille sausage. My husband has had the chicken and waffles, the rotisserie chicken and the steak and enchilada. He loves all of these. It seems like you can do no wrong with whatever you choose off the founding farmer's menu. At the end of your meal you HAVE to try their beignets. It comes with a jam and caramel dipping sauce and when you bite into the beignet it is fluffy and hallow. It takes about 20 min for them to make it so let your server know so you don't have to wait too long. Founding farmers is an extremely popular restaurant  in DC. There is always a wait. My husband always makes reservations online when he knows he is coming to DC. It doesn't seem like it is too hard to get a reservation so why not save yourself sometime and make the reservation. I can't wait till the next time I'm back so I can eat here again."
Kenneth R.,"Berkeley, CA",5/2/2017,5.0,"I came to FFDC on the basis of reviews from my Yelp (and real life) friends Jennifer W. and Allen T.  Allen T.'s review was over-the-top enthusiastic about the Yankee pot roast ($16), which I therefore ordered immediately on sitting down at the bar.  I also got a Brooklyn IPA of some sort, which was a fine accompaniment to the pot roast.  The bartender recommended that I order nothing more -- ""it's a lot of food, and it includes vegetables.""He was spot on!  The pot roast came with gravy, mashed potatoes, green beans and (of course!) the mini fried onion rings at the top.  The combination was delicious and well conceived.  As far as I can see, this is the kind of dish that you get if you cook chuck roast in a pressure cooker for a long time (or a basic pot for an even longer time).  I've made dishes like this with red wine as the braising liquid, and the result is always delicious.  Founding Farmers definitely gets it right.My only gripe -- an extremely minor one -- is that the cloth napkin I was given smelled seriously of rancid grease.  I associate this smell with gym towels that were used for massages and soaked up massage oil before they were thrown in the laundry.  So yuck, but no one's perfect.The quality/price ratio at Founding Fathers is very high.  That's surely a big part of the reason that I saw a large of people at the entrance in search of tables.  (Reading Yelp reviews, I can offer the guess that many of those at the entrance had reservations and were waiting for their tables to be ready!)  I was lucky that there were two seats at the bar when I showed up: according to the woman at the front podium, the bar is nearly always full during the dinner hour."
Mb M.,"Washington, DC",9/7/2017,5.0,Great staff! Make sure to have full party when you come in for res- ESPECIALLY on a Sunday.
JUSTINE M.,"Philadelphia, PA",9/3/2017,4.0,"Very good service! Shoutout to Andrew who made our party feel very welcome. He went above and beyond to ensure we had a good experience that we insisted upon telling his manager.The experience was so good that after our dinner experience, we came back for brunch 2 days later with our group.For dinner, we got the deviled eggs (alright), avocado burger (a bit over cooked), blue cheese burger (delicious and vegetarian option available), and chocolate layer cake (amazing!)For breakfast, if you don't have a reservation, you better get there before the restaurant opens at 830 because the line starts forming at 8 AM. A tip would be to go to the bar area if you can. The service was very nice and brunch was tasty too.Highly recommend if in DC as it's trendy, good service and most of the food is tasty."
Keong Min Y.,"Atlanta, GA",9/14/2017,3.0,It's an okay place. I am confused as to why people wait in line for this place.
Rheya B.,"Fairfax, VA",8/19/2017,4.0,"Came here with a girlfriend for dinner and literally died and went to heaven! (The crab dip is to blame!)Many friends have recommended this hot spot so I was more than excited to FINALLY visit!!There is a line wrapped around the door so be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for a seat. For starters we shared the crab dip which was so delicious! The meat was fresh and the dip had amazing flavor as well as a little bit of a spice which made it out of this world!For entrees we both settled for the chicken and waffles which was very tasty! It came with a side of green beans which we swapped with home style mashed potatoes as well as a side of mac and cheese. I wasn't a huge fan of the mac and cheese seeing as the flavor was lack luster and noodles were a bit too large making it difficult for the sauce to absorb. But the waffles were so delicious as well as the chicken and mashed potatoes! If in the area and curious about the hype, it's worth a stop in!!"
Joan Y.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",5/1/2017,3.0,"To keep it concise: the food was a lot ""prettier"" than it tasted. Not that the food was bad, but it did lack flavor in my opinion.I got the pork sandwich while my boyfriend got the french dip sandwich. We felt that for both of our sandwiches the meat was very dry. The bread looked like it would taste very good and crunchy, but it was very stale and improperly heated. It tasted as if the bread was frozen and they didnt heat it all the way through before serving. Despite my disappointment in the food, I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the attentiveness of our waitress. As much as Id like to recommend Founding Farmers, as it is one of the most reviewed spots in the DC area, I was not impressed by their food. Solid 3 stars from me, and I believe that is being quite generous on my part."
Emily H.,"Minneapolis, MN",7/25/2017,3.0,"I haven't eaten at Founding Farmers for awhile, but was in the area on a recent business trip.  This restaurant gets a ton of hype and I love that they source locally produced foods. I ate breakfast on a weekday morning at the bar and the bartender was very nice and attentive.  The food was OK--nothing out of this world. The bacon is delicious, but the eggs and pancakes were pretty blah.  I wonder if I would have gotten the chicken and waffles or veggie hash if that would have been more flavorful? I probably will rerun, but I just wouldn't get the founding farmers breakfast again and would love to see some more variety on their menu."

Updated review",5.0,"Absolutely delightful bar service. Asked the bartender for something light & fruity. He presented me w/the Cucumber Delight. Great choice! Sister-friend & I dined on Fried Green Tomatoes, Blue Cheese Bacon Dates, Yankee Pot Roast & Farmhouse Platter. Tomatoes were well seasoned. The batter, solid & crispy on the outside, while leaving the tomato meaty & fresh on the inside. The dates were a well balance of creamy blue cheese & dates w/thick cut, slightly sweet bacon. The Farmhouse Platter was absolutely delicious, giving a sample of several menu items!!! Sister-friend stated her pot roast was tastu as well.Will return to try differnt menu items."
DeAnna S.,"Eau Claire, WI",8/21/2017,5.0,"Delicious Food & Hearty PortionsThis is a very crowded spot, but so worth the wait! If you can find a spot at the bar and don't mind eating there, it is much faster than waiting for a table. For a larger city, the prices are comparable. However, the portions are HUGE! Their chicken pot pie was made with a crescent style crust. Fresh chicken breast and veggies are hidden underneath. There are mushrooms in it, that I haven't had before. The turkey sandwich was made on a delicious bread that made it stand out! The deviled eggs are outstanding! I was also pleased to see the gender neutral bathrooms! Enjoy."

Updated review",5.0,"I've been to dinner twice and brunch once, and every experience has been really great!  It starts with terrific hand-crafted cocktails.  I am a big fan of Aviations.  Lots of bars have them, but they're often too sweet, or made with sub-standard ingredients.  These bartenders know how to get just the right color and flavor - it's perfect!  I've loved most of the specialty items, like the chicken and waffles and chicken pot pie.  The trout special was absolutely delicious.  But the appetizers and sides steal the show.  The fried green tomatoes, devil-ish eggs, kettle corn pot, and double-whipped mashed potatoes are outstanding.  And brunch is just wonderful.  The black pepper bacon is savory and sweet, with a bit of heat.  And I really recommend the leek hash.  With scrambled eggs and tomatoes, it was a great breakfast.  Then don't miss the Peanut Butter Banana Toast.  It sounds campy, but it's wonderful - the perfect balance of savory and sweet.  The only thing I wasn't wild about was the short ribs, which had a really strong barbecue sauce.  I just didn't get it - it covered up the flavor of the meat.  They also offer a BBQ sauce for bacon, which seems like it begs the same question...why?  But others may love it, and it was cooked perfectly.  Seating can take a while, so it's best to reserve in advance."
Michelle Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/30/2017,4.0,"Party of five came here on a Saturday afternoon with a reservation and this place was packed! The place is very nicely decorated and we were seated quickly by the hosts once everyone arrived. I really like how big and open this place is and I didn't feel crammed like I normally do in New York restaurants. For my meal, I ordered Breakfast Chicken and Waffles. The food came out fairly quickly and the waiting staff was very nice. I really enjoyed my waffles because they were fluffy and my chicken was hot and crispy as well. I would never come here on a whim without a reservation but it was a nice way to jump start my mini DC getaway."
Siwen W.,"Pasadena, CA",8/23/2017,5.0,Came twice in our four days trip. So you know how badly e love this place. Just make sure you have a reservation no matter what time you want to come. Always a long line for waiting. Tried prime rib and steak salad in the first time and then short rib and filet. Never disappointed us. The meat just tasted amazingly fresh. Beignet is also really good. Love the caramel with it the best!
galina n.,"New York, NY",8/28/2017,4.0,"First of all, they keep this restaurant so cold, my daughter and I were chilled to my bones. Otherwise, the food was good. In NYC, this is the standard but in Washington, D.C., this seems like quite a find! We had:* Corn bread in skillet: not my flavor; a little underdone almost like a quiche in the middle but my family enjoyed it. Had a real corn flavor which was welcome.* Flat bread with brie, apple, and caramelized/pickled onions: This was good, not great. Again, I felt like this is marketed as something so extraordinary but we're from NYC where this seemed just average to me.* Cedar-plank salmon with whipped potatoes and broccolini: delicious; the mashed potatoes were my favorite part* Rib eye with potatoes and spinach: Good, not great but really fatty. Spinach was mediocre.* Crab cakes: most expensive thing on the menu and we had to send them back because they were a raw mixture of mustard and something crap tasting. They were BAD.* Grilled cheese with tomato soup for my 7-year-old because we were never offered a children's menu and picked something off the regular menu for her. It was made with muenster cheese, which is delicious cold but flavorless melted. The soup was spicy, which was maybe the idea to embellish the flavor of the sandwich, but she didn't care for it. It tasted more like a liquified version of a pasta sauce.* Dark chocolate ice cream was delicious and rich* Strawberry milk shake was huge but did not need the two oversized scoops of whipped cream on it * Apple pie: huge portion with a crumble on top rather than traditional pie. It was cinnamon rich and buttery."

Amber Q.,"Wellesley, MA",7/9/2017,1.0,"(First time visit) Maybe it's because my expectation was too high, but I simply can't say that I am very impressed. Food was good, atmosphere was good, service was good, but nothing stood out (gave a four star)EDIT: went to the place again today (changed to one star). I had a reservation at 12:45. My entire three people party got there at 12:40. went up to the hosts and asked to be seated and were told that we would be seated momentarily. They in fact told us that 5 times. They also said there were three tables in front of us; and I swear at least 5 other three people groups were seated before us. I counted because I was mad  we ended up being seated at 1:30 pm. WHAT IS THE POINT OF A RESERVATION IF YOU ARE NOT GONNA HAVE A TABLE READY FOR US?Food was good, like last time, but the frustrating experience made the visit not worth it."
Matt L.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/14/2017,1.0,"I would have been disappointed after a 1 star review, but after 4 stars I'm in disbelief.  It's clear that this establishment spends more time managing its Yelp rating rather than it's food and service.  For a place that prides itself on 'making everything from scratch' the food is abysmal.  The grilled cheese felt like something one would be served in a school cafe, the fried were cold, soggy and greasy, the drinks were unadventurous poorly made - who has ever been told that the bartender would only make a drink with one kind of rum when they have the more premium version in stock and used in their other cocktails.  I wouldn't even roll a dice on this place and risk it with the plethora of mediocre reviews."
Julia K.,"Boston, MA",4/15/2017,3.0,"All Ameri-CAN food in the capitol of the USA but not the large portions you may have thought. You'll definitely need a reservation as this is a go to spot for locals and tourists alike. The restaurant is huge with two stories and a sizable bar area. Rundown:FIG & PROSCIUTTO FLATBREAD - Three slices of crusty bread topped with thin slices of prosciutto, a creamy cheese, fresh figs and drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Great combo of flavors but nothing too special. The bread itself could have been more flavorful to help bring this app up a notch.PORK CHOP W/MAC N CHEESE (+ $2) & CANDIED SWEET POTATO - The mains come with two market sides. We paid a little extra to get the mac n cheese, which was underwhelming to tell you the truth. Especially, for something that costs extra. The pork was tender and moist, with a bit of a gravy from the natural juices. The candied sweet potato paired nicely with the savory pork and rich mac n cheese. Our portions were a little small relative to other tables, but we were satisfied.SALMON W/GREEN BEANS & STEWED CARROTS - Nicely seared, crusted and moist salmon served on a cedar plank with a hint of cajun seasoning but a bit oily. The sides were also glistening albeit there wasn't that much of each to consume. CARROT CAKE - HUGE slice of cake, very moist and full of warm spices and cream cheese frosting! They were also nice to add a candle in the slice to help celebrate my bday."
Stephanie P.,"New York, NY",7/15/2017,4.0,"Definitely make a reservation ahead of time especially if you are planning to go on the weekend. I came here with 2 other people on a Saturday night and we ended up waiting 70 minutes for seating. We ordered the skillet cornbread, kettle corn pot, fish and chips, and mushroom sausage gnocchi. The cornbread is really good- would highly recommend. The kettle corn is okay too but we finished less than half- there's just way too much for 3 people. Taking off a star because although the food is pretty good, the price is too high and the portions are way off. There wasn't much gnocchi and not enough fish for the fish n chips plate. In conclusion, don't think it was worth the hour wait."
Kate F.,"San Jose, CA",7/20/2017,3.0,"A solid 4 stars is about right for this place. I decided to try if because it had SO many reviews and I wanted to see what the hullabaloo was about.Made reservations on Opentable for 1:10pm on a Thursday afternoon. We cabbed across town to get there (although it is super close to a Metro stop).It was SO crowded and there is no place comfortable to wait in (totally chaotic and was not a good start). The waiters go through yelling names for parties to be seated (I would much rather see the buzzy system where you are given a pager).Anyhow, we were seated by 1:20 (not worried about the 10 minutes).Curtis was our server, very nice guy. This was lunch with my 4 year old son and I so I ordered appropriately for him (and me).Kettle Corn for our appetizer- I was a bit bummed as I knew there are other things I should try on the menu, but I ordered this for Thomas. It ended up a super win as we both loved it and the presentation was fun (it also served as our appetizer and our dessert and we took a lot home!)Mini Cheeseburgers (3) for the kiddo - This was 3 cheeseburger sliders and a healthy side of fries. I tried the cheeseburgers and they were SUPER good. The fries were not my type of fries.Cauliflower steak & Rissotto for me -- it was good, not great, but good. I got stuck on the rissotto and I love veggies. Next time I would order something else. Too much butter/oil in this dish for me.I also ordered a ""Dealers Choice"" drink, meaning the bartender made me a drink, I just gave him parameters (gin & savory) -- To die for, it was one of the two best gin drinks in my life.If we go back, I would just order the popcorn and the burgers. That would be enough for us to split and be happy. We are from the Bay Area and I can think of a bunch of places like this at home, so for me, I liked the restaurant and would go back, but there are so many other restaurants I would rather try here."
Mike M.,"Seattle, WA",8/27/2017,3.0,"Man, I really wanted to like this place.  That said, Founding Fathers just can't keep up with their success.  Line out the door, tasty coffee, and great smelling food. Sat at the bar. Problem is the staff and kitchen are seemingly too busy to get you that food in a timely or correct manner.Ordered 2 cup French press, mimosa and pastrami hash with 2 poached eggs.  Mimosas, fast served and tasty.  Coffee, had to ask 10 mins after ordering where it was.  Bar server sent someone looking for it and finally made an appearance. Pastrami hash looked and smelled great....but didn't have pastrami...sigh.  asked to fix it, and  pastrami chunks show up 10 mins later...food is cold now and didn't eat it.Still hungry so gave them another chance with Eggs Benedict.   At least that was good.Guy next to me ordered something to go and it shows up on a plate.  Kitchen just can't get it right.Maybe next time, but will probably try something else given that aforementioned line out the door."
Aya E.,"Sacramento, CA",7/17/2017,4.0,"Most reviews in the DC area? I had to see what the hype was about. My group of 4 and I came in at 11:30am on a Saturday and thankfully we had made a reservation beforehand because it was packed and who knows how long the wait would have been.Also FYI, they will not seat you unless your whole party is there! After several minutes of arriving, we were seated and given menus.We started with the Skillet Cornbread ($5) and it was like no other I've had before! There were real corn bits in there and it was served with honey and butter. It was great but don't load up on this before all the actual food comes!We also ordered the Carrot Cake Pancakes. It was such a unique flavor and I'm a sucker for carrot cake so I decided to give it a try. It was good but not great, to be honest. We could have done without it. There were real carrot shreds in there but for some reason, it tasted like something was missing. I wouldn't recommend it!I ordered the Vegetarian scramble ($10) which came in a side and bread so I chose hashbrowns and an English muffin. The scramble was delicious. I loved all the different vegetables BUT the dish was way too oily. I wish they used much less oil because this dish could have been pretty healthy otherwise. The hashbrowns and English muffin were fine too but definitely not the star of the dish. For $10, I think it was well worth it.I would love to come back and try their lunch/dinner foods but this spot is a must try in DC!"
Kate M.,"Washington, DC",8/25/2017,3.0,"This is a classic stop in DC, so do not walk in without a reservation! If you live in the area or are here for a while, do stop by. My dish (cauliflower risotto) was delicious, and my friend really enjoyed her steak and frites. Some relatively minor gripes are that there are no bread bowls (though the popcorn in a bucket appetizer is really original), the restaurant is very loud, and service could be significantly more attentive. Their brunch is generally more highly regarded than their dinner, so I would make a point to come her for brunch instead if possible!"
Jessie S.,"Manhattan, NY",9/14/2017,3.0,"I really love their chicken and waffles, and the potatoes and pretty much everything else on the menu. BUT the customer service is not so great. I know this is weird, but I called them on national pancake day - because that's a thing - and asked them if they would still serve pancakes after breakfast and they refused...I know that's a weird example, but I feel like restaurants can and should go above and beyond for customers no matter how strange the ask is- they serve pancakes for breakfast, so they could have easily whipped some up for lunch! But again, everything is delicious. So I can't complain too much."
Apearl C.,"Atlanta, GA",4/4/2017,5.0,"Thoroughly enjoyed Sunday lunch at this restaurant. I was visiting from out of town and met a group of girlfriends here. We had a great time. Food was AMAZING. Our server was the best! I cannot remember his name but he is from LA and has the best eyebrows in DC!Only hiccup we encountered was waiting for our table even though we made a reservation. One person in our party of 5 was running behind and we basically had to negotiate to sit down. Annoying!Drinks were delicious! We sampled several appetizers. My favorites were the garlic wings, friend green tomatoes and cornbread! I ordered meatloaf with mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. Everything was amazing!"
Charlotte H.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",7/14/2017,5.0,"I went here as a party of 6, on a Saturday morning we knew it was going to be busy and that we would wait. Luckily, we got a table right away, as long as we were able to leave after an hour and a half (they must have had a reservation) The hosts are on top of their game, the servers are friendly, efficient, polite, and helpful. Our server was all that, we ordered the Beignets for starters, AMAZING! Perfect amount for a 6-top. Big, fluffy, crispy perfection with three different dipping sauces. I ordered the Tomato Florentine, the best hollandaise sauce I've ever had with crispy hash browns (see photo) my friends ordered chicken and waffles- they were very pleased! The re-fillable coffee was delicious too! The price is acceptable for the quality of the food, very satisfied! I would re-visit no question!"
Denise E.,"Washington, DC",9/14/2017,5.0,"So, this place is pricey, but the food and service is good. There is usually street parking directly across from the restaurant.I really enjoy the deviled eggs and any of their desserts. If you like coffee, they offer a French press right to your table.A go to spot for brunch with the girls or a night out with the boo."
Arlo S.,"Media, PA",9/8/2017,5.0,"This place did everything right.  The food and service were excellent. I visited for dinner and now i plan to visit for brunch.  If your are planning to visit during the weekend, my advice is to make a reservation way in advance.I highly recommend."

Updated review",2.0,"I went to Founding Farmers DC on 4th of July, and the experience was..different. Our server was great, at times overwhelmed (but that was totally understandable). The food was..bland. The farmhouse platter is my go to - and I sure do love it. I told my friend who didn't order it that they would regret not doing so. Unfortunately, turns out I was the one doing the regretting. The corn on the cob and ribs were good, the burgers were tasteless (think college cafeteria) and the hot dog tasted like it came fresh off the frozen foods section. Restaurants have off days, so it is what it is. There is a pattern of disappointment emerging though. At this point, I should just stop going there - but folks who I want to dine with still seem to prefer it (most having never been there before). No one on my latest party enjoyed their meal, so I suspect founding farmers is off the list for future meals. It's unfortunate because I want to like Founding Farmers, and clearly they've done something right to earn their reputation for excellence. I'm honestly just confused - is founding farmers just trying to do too much now? The customer experience seems to be low on their priority list. Ignore the food and service, the best example of this is the chaos that one walks into as soon as you enter the restaurant. About 15-20 people milling around waiting to be called for the reservations they already made. It's a scene reminiscent of an united airlines luggage counter."
S T.,"Denver, CO",9/7/2017,3.0,"This place is good, not great. We had a reservation and arrived to a paked entry way. We had a small wait and then got escorted to our table. The service at the entrance and for the whole brunch was not good. I'd say slow and marginal. We had to hear our name barely shouted over the crowd to get called for our tsble. We almost missed it. As far as the brrakfast food goes, its good....just not amazing. The best thing I had was a piece of bread witb banana peanut butter and chocolate. That's more of a snack I can make at home though. My eggs tasted different. I think they are riding the hype but they don't have anything for breakfast that stood out from a local neighborhood place."

Updated review",1.0,"I heard rave reviews about this spot so upon visiting I decided to check it out. The cornbread with honey butter should get 5 stars on its own. Best damn cornbread I've ever had! It's served in a small skillet and has chunks of actual corn inside. The butter honey is a must! The menu is vast and there are vegetarian options as well. It's a perfect spot for anyone because there's so many items on the menu. The  bread selections as appetizers are the way to go! The brie options is amazing. The bread is perfectly toasted. My cousin got the chicken and waffles which is a staple item on the menu. The desert beignets are also a must have! Both are heavy but worth every single calorie! Good home cooking! You may be asking why the three stars? Here's why: server was a bit impatient and his recommendations were not good. He also questioned me about my tip which I thought was beyond rude! (Btw I tipped him Typical 15%). The shrimp buncatta pasta recommended by my server was tasty, but it was a bit heavy on the oil side. It was good the first 6 bites then I couldn't eat anymore. If you are in the area I would try it! Doesn't matter how full you are get the beignets! UPDATE: I hate to say it, but I had to reduce from 3 star to one due to the horrible service  yet again.  The food is great and there is no arguing that. We went for brunch this time, but again we had horrible service. I don't get what it is about this location, but the Servers all have a bad attitude and are just rude. Our server came to our table once took our order and never came back again. Forgot our coffees, didn't bring us utensils, or even jam for our biscuits.  We had to keep flagging down staff to help us.  Our server didn't even come to bring us our check. Only time we say her again was to pick up the tip. Truly just bad bad bad service."
Helen H.,"San Diego, CA",3/25/2017,3.0,"Overhyped. We made reservations for 11am, arrived on time and were seated by 11:15. The wait at the door was insane! Reservations are highly recommended. I personally wouldn't wait long for a seat here. BANANA FOSTER PANCAKES ($9) - 3 stacks, nice and fluffy. They could have been more generous with the banana foster... otherwise it's not that special. CHICKEN POT PIE ($14) - Good crispy crust with flavorful filling. Big chunks of chicken with carrots, peas and the usual. I saw a lot of people order the beignets but we didn't have room for it :( The rest of the menu looked really standard. I'm not sure what the big deal was for this restaurant honestly. It's good, but I expected spectacular based on the 8K+ reviews. Service was great though, no complaints."
Lorraine M.,"Coral Gables, FL",7/13/2017,5.0,This was the highlight of my D.C. visit this evening.  I started with a delightful cocktail - cucumber delight.  Aptly named. Besides the cucumber favor... there was melons. It was really good.   My friends suggested the Cornbread skillet.  Wow. Served with whipped butter and honey. Warm and delicious. The menu options made it difficult to decide. I opted for the Braided Short Ribs. With warm spinach and pickled potato salad. It is a weeknight and the place is hopping. Couples and groups fill the tables and booths. But the service is excellent. I dined alone but was well taken care of. My cocktail and cornbread arrived together. Followed shortly by the short ribs. They were tender and flavorful.  And the contrast with the cold salad and warm spinach were the perfect combination with the ribs.  Definitely merits many returns.  Bookmarked!My suggestion make reservations or expect a wait.
James G.,"Washington, DC",6/27/2017,3.0,"I've visited Founding Farmers a few different times for both brunch and dinner and although the food is always delicious and fresh, I'm never blown away.First, the food. Founding Farmers has some amazing and fresh farm to table options and this place is great for vegetarians or mixed carnivore/vegetarian parties. Although the food is good, it's pricy. You can find similar quality food elsewhere in DC for a lower price point with some quick searching.The biggest issue with FF is the crowds (and as a result, the service). There are just too many people packed into the place. Every corner boasts a new noisy group of tourists, and as a result, the poor waitstaff are always running all over. The wait is long (sometimes even if you have a reservation), and it's always a line just to get in the door. Forget about a large party without a reservation booked well in advance.I would stop by if you're a vegetarian party or are looking for a decent brunch, which tends to be more reasonably priced. If you're looking to avoid tourists or have a meal where you can hear each other speak, give this place a pass. If you're really into FF, try it's companion restaurant Farmers, Fishers, and Bakers, which has a great view of the waterfront and is a little less crowded."
Hannah S.,"Washington, DC",9/6/2017,4.0,Went here for brunch with a friend from out of town. I ordered the goat cheese and beet poached eggs and my friend ordered the steak an eggs. Overall it was very good!! It was a little on the salty side for my personal taste but the staff was very friendly. I will also add we got the peanut butter toast with bananas and chocolate chips and it was delicious!!!! I will definitely come here again!
Allister D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3/21/2017,4.0,"This place is awesome and they serve fresh food with unique flavors. I totally recommend coming early before they open because it can get packed quick! I say go straight to the bar if thing's get too packed.I ordered their chicken & waffles which was just alright. I thought the chicken pieces were a bit small and not as crispy. The waffle was plain but their syrup is delicious and is much needed on the chicken. They don't have Crystal hot sauce so settle with the Tobasco. I recommend ordering their black pepper maple bacon which is sweet, glazed with a good amount of sugar and has a smokey black pepper coating. This restaurant reminds me of the White Oak in ATL. It has the same feel, food choice, and unique flavored menu. There's no going around this, arrive early and fight for a spot."
Magda S.,"New York, NY",3/24/2017,4.0,"Founding Farmers IS THE PLACE to go and eat and enjoy! It's worth to wait for a table because once you're in they will take you on this amazing journey of tastes.My friend recommended this place to us saying that it's 100% organic, supporting local farmers and everything is fresh. He was so right. We left full and happy. Everything that we tried was delicious. We started with the small farmer salad - the portion was so big so I don't want to think how big regular is. Then we got grilled cheese sandwich which came with tomato soup, and chicken and waffles with carrots on a side. Hard to choose what was my favorite.we've heard that they have amazing desserts too. So we decided to try apple pie that came with scoop of ice cream, and black and white shake.We rolled out after two hours of amazing feast and can't wait to go back there."
Davisson H.,"Arlington, VA",9/9/2017,5.0,Probably my default favorite restaurant. Cannot go wrong with the corn bread and chicken & waffles. Everything else is also delicious. Literally EVERYTHING. Service is always friendly. Would definitely recommend reservations.
Kristen P.,"Alexandria, VA",9/11/2017,3.0,"Went to Founding Farmers after a day in DC celebrating the bf's birthday. Enjoyed the fact that they offered some traditional comfort foods on their menu. I ordered a drink that unfortunately was so smokey that it was undrinkable. The breads, chips and crisps appetizers were pretty good; decent size with some delicious dips (onion dip by far the best). Also opted for the fried green tomatoes which were also pretty good. For entrees the bf got the meatloaf and I had the creamy veg. bacon bucatini. Again, the bacon was super smoked so it slightly overpowered the rest of the dish. Overall we both enjoyed the meal, which was finished off with a slice of delicious cheesecake - best thing of the night."
Amanda F.,"Pawtucket, RI",9/1/2017,5.0,"Second time here! This time we just got Apple pie to go. Just look at the crumble on top! So delicious. Didn't wait long at all, and we were still offered water as we waited for our dessert."
Tony C.,"Des Plaines, IL",8/16/2017,5.0,"Founding Farmers is 100% my favorite spot in DC and I go every time I'm in town.  The food is all very good and the menu changes to reflect seasonal highlights and regional specialties.  The space is very modern, and I always feel like I'm cozy but still get a cool social vibe.  There's a few community tables and it's great to be able to chat up locals and travelers when you're there.  I have had breakfast, lunch, and dinner - all are thoroughly thought out and prepared with care.  The service is really great and I feel like everyone on staff is there to help.  Water glasses and cocktails are rarely left empty for more than a few moments.  Favorites include:Shrimp and Grits (I think of this often)Short RibCauliflower Steak and RisottoDevilish Eggs are a must haveGet in there and find out what the farmers are founding..."
Sean F.,"Beltsville, MD",3/15/2017,4.0,"I've been to Founding Farmers a couple times, once for dinner and another time for brunch. Yes, it is very popular. I don't think I've ever seen this place without a decent crowd. The menu has a variety of options for almost anyone who like to eat. I've gotten lucky both times and haven't had to deal with much of a wait. I'd recommend a reservation if possible but you might get lucky with a walk in. The food that I've had here has always been good. Most recently for brunch I had the chicken and waffles with the peanut butter banana toast. The chicken was similar to chik fil a strips with a slightly different seasoning. The waffle was light and crisp. The white gravy served on the side was only alright to me. The peanut butter banana toast was good and I liked the small dark chocolate balls that cover it. I had a Bellini which was made with real peach, very good but also $12. I sampled someone's red velvet pancakes and was impressed with how soft and fluffy they were. I don't remember my dinner meal but it was also good.The service I've had has always been prompt and attentive. Both Bellini's I ordered during brunch did take quite a while to come out but everything else came out in good time. Overall I'd say it's a good spot for a date or a group."
Alexandria L.,"Waterford Township, MI",8/6/2017,5.0,"This place should be a brunch mecca if it isn't already.We stopped here for a weekday brunch around 11. There was a short wait but we sat at the bar to skip it. There is a hip, eclectic, apothecary feel. The bartenders were efficient and attentive. From a tourist's perspective, it seems to be another spot that owes it's being to city gentrification.Talk about fresh food! I was stunned by the deliciousness of each and every bite I tried. The egg cream is simply amazing. I come from Detroit where chicken and waffles are a breakfast, lunch, and dinner staple at a lot of restaurants. Not wanting to stray too far from my comfort food zone, I ordered my customary chicken and waffles and it was hands down the best chicken and waffles I have ever had and one of the more reasonably priced, too. The gravy was fantastic, I only wished for more! It also came with eggs which I appreciated. Additionally, I tried my husband's strawberry stuffed french toast and was pleasantly surprised as it's not a dish I usually like. The strawberries were real and delicious. There was not a drop of fake strawberry syrup to be seen. Both dishes featured large portions.Based on my one visit, this place is not to be missed. SO many good brunch choices, it's hard to choose. Try the chicken and waffles; you won't be disappointed."
Jessica N.,"Silver Spring, MD",4/9/2017,3.0,"We visited on a recent weekend night. We were a large group and were surprised at how poor and inattentive the service was. They were out of many items on the menu which the waiter informed us matter of factly and without apology. He indicated this often happened on the weekend, but seeing that we were there at 7:30, you would expect the restaurant to make adjustments and order larger quantities of popular dishes to account for the demand. As for the food, it was overall a pretty good meal which made up for the service. We enjoyed the delectable bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese. Yum. I had the crab cakes (second choice as they ran out of lobster Mac n cheese). The crab cakes were full of crab rather than filling and were very tasty. For sides, I had the Mac n cheese which was disappointing - just noodles with a very light cheese sauce, not at all the decadent side I was anticipating. I also had the roasted carrots which were delicious. We also had the rib eye which was a decent steak.  For desserts, we sampled the carrot cake (fabulous), the beignets (bland), and the apple cranberry crumble (boring)."
Jason L.,"Dallas, TX",9/11/2017,4.0,"The Bloody Marys are FANTASTIC here!  The service is great and the food is SO SO delicious.  The staff does a great job with the crowds.  Oh, make sure you go with the thick bacon with breakfast.  It's so worth the extra $4 with the set-menu.We will definitely return to Founding Farmers."
Reza F.,"Rensselaer, NY",7/13/2017,5.0,"Hands down one of the best tasting food I've ever had at restaurants. The reservation could be tricky, but try the online portal at OpenTable and plan wayy in advance. I'm looking forward to trying their brunch that everyone says is to die for. Great service here as well!Oh and definitely leave some room for desert! Their carrot cake with vanilla ice cream scoop on the side is amazing, with julienne sliced carrots inside: very delicious."
Ashante D.,"New York, NY",8/24/2017,4.0,"This place is raved about for a reason! They are doing a whole lot right at this restaurant. Made a reservation the night of. We got there early so sat at the bar and waited for our table. Bartenders weren't  helpful in making suggestions to order. Luckily we all knew what we wanted. Ordered some cornbread while we waited, very tasty but a bit too much corn for my liking.Finally, we get seated and that's when our experience turned for the better. Our waiter was thee ABSOLUTE best! Funny, suggestive and accommodating! The drinks he suggested definite was what we were looking for. Packed a punch but not overwhelming. And the Food!! The vegan meatloaf!! One of the best vegan dishes ever had! Other dishes were the chicken wings, Mac and cheese and a shrimp dish which wasn't too outstanding.Our waiter even indulged us in playing a joke on one of the members of our party! Great place! Will definitely return when in DC again"
Alex E.,"Elkridge, MD",6/15/2017,4.0,"Founding Farmers is my go-to brunch spot when in DC. And for good reason!I went the other week with a friend of mine before heading out to the national mall. Even though we had made a reservation prior, we had to wait for a short time. Honestly it seemed as the reservation wait time and walk-in wait time we're the same. I would still suggest making a reservation or calling especially when you know it may be busy (weekends, noon, etc.)We were taken upstairs to be seated. The environment of the restaurant was young but also had vintage decor. Large windows allow you to see the neighboring buildings almost wherever you sit.Water was brought to us shortly in an old fashioned milk jug. For me, the brunch menu is more appetizing than the lunch or dinner menu. A classic is the Chicken & Waffles, which I ordered with a side of Mac and cheese and watermelon with mint. The waffles were light and crispy and the chicken was tender and moist. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy.All in all, the food was delicious! Founding Farmers is a great brunch spot when you want some comfort food when in DC! I would say give it a try ;)"
Jenna G.,"San Francisco, CA",3/24/2017,4.0,"Number one advice for this place: definitely make a reservation. It is super crowded and popular. My boyfriend and I came here at 12pm on a Friday in March, thinking it wouldn't be that crowded, and it was packed. The wait was an hour or open seating at bar, but you have to awkwardly hover over people and swoop their seats when they leave (which is what we did). I personally did not like sitting at the bar because I felt very stressed out with all the commotion going on around me (other people trying to swoop, bartenders being super busy), so I would definitely make a reservation for a table next time I came here.Food: I got the chicken and waffles which came with 7 cheese mac & cheese and a side, I picked brussel sprouts. For $16, not a bad deal and a lot of food. It was definitely really good. My boyfriend got the burger which he said was also good, and I had some of his fries which weren't the best fries ever, but I love fries so I still liked them.Overall: Good food, but make a reservation."
Daniel D.,"Glen Burnie, MD",9/8/2017,4.0,"I was in D.C. early one morning and decided to stop by Founding Farmers for breakfast; that was a great decision! I would ding this establishment for its lack of vegan options, and this is my only gripe. I ordered sautéed vegetables, potatoes, toast, and freshly squeezed orange juice. It was an amazing breakfast, so good that I felt guilty and grabbed my wife the same meal to go (married readers will understand lol). Great customer services. The staff were really friendly and knowledgeable. When I told the waiter I was a vegan, he knew exactly what items on the menu I could not have. There was a muffin I had my eye on, but he warned me that it had dairy in it.  Thanks for the save buddy!"
Rachel S.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",8/16/2017,2.0,"I've been to Farmers Fishers Bakers a few times, and during my first visit to Founding Farmers I expected to encounter the same vibe. This was not the case--it was bustling and noisy, close-fitting and crowded tables, and lots of children. In other words, not my ideal type of place to go from the get-go, but it still seemed like it would be great and delicious. We arrived ten minutes early for our reservation, but still had to wait about 20 minutes past our reservation time before we were seated. Frustrating, but it was fine--we were with a large out of town group, so had plenty to talk about and keep us busy until we were seated, and the food smelled fantastic.We ordered appetizers, drinks, meals, and dessert from across the menu, and the general consensus was that the food was overall good, albeit way too salty.For the things I tried:Apps: crab dip- fine but too salty... nothing special; fried green tomatoes- kind of hard to mess these up; cornbread- too mushy; deviled eggs- not good; mussels w/ sausage- delicious.I had chicken pot pie for my main course, and that was actually very good. Everyone else said their food was too salty, but somehow the pot pie escaped the over-salted fate that most of the other food at Founding Farmers seemed to suffer. (Run down of what everyone else ordered: chicken-fried steak- too salty; chicken & waffles- good chicken, mediocre waffle; steak- too salty; pork chop- too salty; Cobb salad w shrimp- very good, goat cheese ravioli- too salty; burger- good; ribs- good.)We also tried all three types of cake (chocolate, carrot, and butternut--each piece was DELICIOUS and massive) and the apple pie, which was some of the best restaurant apple pie I've had.The not-great food (aside from dessert) makes it unlikely for me to return again, but the service absolutely ensures I will not be back. Our server was polite and attentive throughout the meal--subpar compared to many DC dining establishments, but nothing to complain about. But, as I mentioned, we were seated twenty minutes past our reservation time, with a large group. Pretty much each of us ordered a three-course meal plus drinks, yet an hour and 40 minutes after being seated, we were definitely getting booted out of our table. Our server cleared plates (fine), but then slowly started taking away things that I have literally never seen cleared while people were still seated: water glasses were removed, even if there was still water in them (and there were no water refills to be had!); I had my hands resting on my napkin on the table, and it was literally pulled from beneath my hands and taken away; and they even cleared two wine glasses that still had wine in them! I honestly could not believe this was happening and our out-of-town guests were also not impressed. For a restaurant group that gets it so right at FFB, I'm pretty surprised by the rude service at the end of our meal."
David V.,"San Antonio, TX",3/5/2017,5.0,"This is as good as you can possibly get to having perfect breakfast. My visit to DC started off with a skip and a hop, and this place will have you fools dancing. I made my reservation online to get some breakfast before hitting the mall strip in DC for the first day, and this was possibly the best decision of the day (albeit DC itself was a glorious experience in and of itself).My wife, sister + bf and I were introduced to a line snaking outside the place before opening, my knees were getting weak, because I knew this to be the precursor of a good time. The place itself was a marvel, beautiful wood floors, and brilliant floor plan. We were taken upstairs and sat at a booth. Now, this is where I made my first mistake. We ordered ""Uncle Buck's Beignets"". For your uncultured people out there like myself, this basically translates to donuts. They placed them in the middle of the table along with three dips: chocolate, raspberry, and caramel. I wasn't particularly fond of the chocolate dip, but the raspberry and caramel dip were sublime. Great starter.So second mistake. I'm a texan alright, and other states when I eat, don't understand that I like big portions, not to mention that more expensive joints have a tendency to give you small portions despite their prices. I had this mindset, so I got myself the farmer's breakfast: Two over-easy eggs, chicken-apple sausage, grilled buttered ciabatta, with leak hash browns. To top it off, I ordered Stuffed Vanilla-Creamed French Toast, the Banana Foster.People, don't be a moron, these people slammed two huge plates in front of me, the french toast didn't look anything like toast, but that blocked shaped, cream filled cake was INSANE. The bananas were an amazing touch, all in all, I knew I was in for a battle. I looked over to our waiter, who looked like Glenn from Walking Dead, and I uttered, ""Glenn, you made it? Those dumpsters, right!?"" He just about pistol whipped me.To top everything off, I ordered two glasses of Mimosas, and we were off to a great start. There wasn't a thing that I tried that I didn't like, and the service was attentive, and it was one of the best breakfasts I've had in recent memory. It was my first time visiting my sister in the area, so it made for a great memory and was honestly just impressed with the wonderfully crafted breakfast that was worth every single penny.Strong recommendations: Always mimosa. Always, even on the job. Stuffed French Toast is to die for. Chicken-Apple sausage is very good, the eggs were done exactly how I love them, and the hash brown was seasoned with true expertise.The only pity is that this place isn't in Texas, people would lose their minds over there. Make sure to reserve ahead of time and arrive timely, you don't want to lose your seats here. You can't even get through the door without a reservation, so plan ahead!"
Katharine F.,"Austin, TX",6/19/2017,4.0,"Yalllllllllllll. Took myself on a date here for my last dinner in DC, and was a little worried about all the ~hype~. I had a 7:45 reservation and was seated at 8 - it was super packed even on a Monday night, and I had to LOL at all the people getting annoyed at the hostess for doing her job. If a place takes reservations, make them, people! Staff up front was sweet and did their best. However, there was a couple next to me who had 7:30 reservations and still weren't seated at 8, so I can understand some grumbling. I ordered the El Presidente cocktail - it was good, nothing to write home about, but appropriately strong and $9. For my entree, I had some guidelines for myself: no burgers and no chicken and waffles (Texas does chicken and waffles gooooood and I wasn't sure this place couldn't compete!). I ended up with the scallops with the butternut risotto, which was a really bold choice for my personal palate. Luckily, the dish was AMAZING. Melt in your mouth delicious - I wanted to lick the plate. Seriously amazing choice. The only reason I'm taking a star off is because of my dessert experience. I was too full to eat a whole  one right then, so I asked my waitress if I could order something to go. On the menu, the cakes are listed with ice cream, so it was my intention to just eat the ice cream and take the cake home. However, when she came back with my bag and check, it was just the slice of cake with the same price tag. This was mildly annoying because it's $8 and the ice creams listed on the dessert menu are either $3 or $5. I didn't want to make a fuss, but she should've inquired if I wanted the ice cream for here or if I didn't mind paying the same price for less food. That was a bit of a bummer. The carrot cake was good, but not the best I've ever had - too many golden raisins in it for me!"
Armani Y.,"Washington, DC",4/4/2017,5.0,"Grey restaurant. As a college student I frequently came here during off peak times in between classes. The food is great and service is even better. I used to eat the red velvet pancakes a lot in college. This was my first time back for brunch since graduation. The pancakes were a little burnt, however the server did all he could do to make sure they were correct. The restaurant is really good about accommodating, but who wants to continuously send thing back.... no one wants to be that person. I ended up eating the second bath of pancakes although still slightly burnt I still somewhat enjoyed them. Our server ended up taking them off the bill without us even having to ask. I didn't mind paying for them considering I ate them. Overall great food and great service. If you want a brunch reservation attempt to make it a week ahead!"
Vanessa D.,"Washington, DC",6/27/2017,3.0,"DISCLAIMER: this review is specific to THIS visit (I had better experiences my first and second times)I've been trying to return here for the last two years to make it my third visit overall. But until this past weekend, I hadn't had a chance. Definitely make a reservation at least 1 week in advance, especially for weekend times.Came here with my partner, like we do every restaurant outing. It was his first time and my third. Though I had called ahead of time to let them know that we were running a few minutes late (9 min to be exact), I was told we had a 15 min grace period anyway. We had to wait in a line before getting to the hostess table. It was still within our 15 min grace period by the time we checked in. But before we got to the hostess, another host told our hostess that she needs to figure out where we're at or they're giving our spot away. I knew they were talking about us, which I thought was slightly rude. But we looked past that. Despite notifying them of our late arrival, we still had to wake 10 min for our table (which I didn't get since I notified them we were coming. Did you give our table away?). It took maybe another 5-7 min till a waiter came up to us when we were seated. But after that, everything went smoothly. Liam was a great server. The food was good, but maybe since this had been 2 years coming, I was expecting to be wowed (especially since I specifically ordered the prime rib dip sandwich after having tasted it for the first time two years ago). Though it was very tasty, it was nothing to rave about. The house made lemonades and sodas are delicious! I got the Mac and cheese as my side - homemade pasta but definitely very basic for Mac and cheese, nothing special. My partner got fries with his sandwich and that was significantly better and very good. Overall, the experience was unexciting and I think part of it was the anticipation of waiting so long and just hyping it up for so long. I'll probably be back because let's be honest, FF is still very delicious and it's definitely worth a repeat."
Ky T.,"Laurel, MD",2/20/2017,3.0,"I'm sure by now you know, Founding Farmers is pretty legit or why else would people have posted close to 6k photos here for it. The soy garlic black pepper wings, crab dip, seafood Bolognese, and double fudge chocolate cake were all good and solid but there was nothing i tasted that was outstanding or exceptional. The bathroom was really huge, well decorated, and clean but nothing looked strikingly memorable, as could be said about the whole restaurant.I enjoyed being seated in a corner booth on the top floor by a huge window overlooking the city. That was my favorite part about my visit to Founding Farmers... A great view of the city. Service from Daniel was ok.... Nothing terrible or great. I'd return if i was invited to attend for someone else's get together but this won't make my date night rotation."
Aileen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/4/2017,4.0,"Thank goodness they take reservations or else it looks like it can be a doozy! The upstairs area is a bit more empty but it was still pretty darn packed before the lunch rush. The upstairs area is also a lot more quiet and I think meant for intimate reservations. I noticed that compared to the downstairs crowd, upstairs had more locals and business colleagues gathered for lunch meetings.I got the shrimp and grits with a side of cornbread. The food took a while to come out, with the cornbread coming out first and the grits coming out later. I could see immediately why the grits took a while. It's far from your average grit meal...it came with a bunch of other goodies that kept the dish strong and full of surprises. There were also sizable shrimp pieces in there and I had to cut them up to chew on with every bite. They easily make the price of the dish worthwhile. I could see the envious stares of those sitting near us because they had ordered salads....ummm why come here to order salad? The cornbread was also good. I was expecting a tiny piece but it was actually it's own ""loaf"" size and I ended up taking most of it home. It didn't have too strong of a corn flavor but it was still good and I would order it again.Service was a bit slow, but that's understandable with the lunch rush. Still, getting a spoon for my grits without having to wait a couple minutes to flag someone down while the heat slipped away would have been nice. They made it up by boxing my food up for me (call me spoiled, but I love it when they do that)."
Brooklyn C.,"District Heights, MD",9/7/2017,5.0,"I had the chicken and waffles tht came with green beans and Mac n cheese. I gave 5 stars because the service was great. The food was good, nothing to rave about. I'll definitely return to try something else though."
Von S.,"Washington, DC",6/27/2017,5.0,"De freaking licious! Hands down the best fresh food I've had in a loooong time. We did make reservations for 9:30pm and was seated promptly. Since all of yelp recommended the wings lol we gave in and got the black garlic wings as the appetizer. Delicious down to the bone! Real talk.For the entree bae got the rotisserie chicken meal it was exquisite and I got the plank salmon, with the mash potatoes and spinach. My fish was topped with apricot so it was kind of sweet but everything was good, especially them mashed potatoes. Soooo tasty!!! Lastly, we had the tequila Paloma I had to get 2 because that first was everything. I really didn't even need the second but I sipped on it for the remaining of the night.We'll be returning with the fam SOON!"
Frank K.,"Washington, DC",3/10/2017,4.0,"I've been meaning to come here for the longest time. After a birthday dinner the other day, I finally got my wish granted. It was incredibly busy, but I guess that's the norm. The decor of the place is really nice, a modern rustic/urban hybrid theme. Think lots of woods and glass.To start our group got the skillet corn bread, which is great. I love the whole corn kernels, and it wasn't dry or anything, just the right consistency. We should have also ordered the devil-ish eggs which everyone here raves about, but that can be for another time. For my entree I got the chicken and waffles, which comes with mac and cheese and an additional side. I got the Brussels sprouts which great. After reading a lot about this entree, it was pretty hyped up but I got to say that it was amazing for fried chicken. The seasoning on the skin was good, peppery but not overpowering, and the meat was well cooked, no awkward tendons or anything. The mac and cheese was alright, nothing overly spectacular, but good nonetheless. The waffles were good too. They look like they'd be a bit hard but actually they're really fluffy.After going to the Tysons and Potomac (MoCo) locations, this location compares admirably. I can't wait to come again to try out the devil-ish eggs and other things on the menu."
Joey M.,"Somerville, MA",6/22/2017,3.0,"There was a lot of hype among yelpers and locals alike and maybe that was founding farmers downfall. We went on a busy memorial day brunch and were able to snag a seat at the bar instead of wait for over an hour for a table - phew! Food was solid, but honestly its an american brunch that is tasty and a little overpriced. The GF ordered the eggs benny but somehow got upcharged for a totally different meal! They apologized and comped us coffee which totally made up for it, which is appreciated. Maybe the food the rest of the day is better or maybe it just takes a lot to impress me at brunch. Who can say for sure.. not me."
Hannah R.,"DuPont, WA",6/6/2017,4.0,"My husband and I both ordered the eggs benedict and it was super tasty. The hollandaise was super buttery and I love the addition of the leeks to the hash browns. My hot chocolate with whipped cream was super yummy. The cups were a bit dirty, which was a little off-putting. Be sure to make a reservation!"
J P.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/7/2017,5.0,Amazing food. It gets really busy and the wait could be up to 2 hours. Be sure to plan ahead and book yourself a reservation. Highly recommend the chicken pot pie and wings!
Risa L.,"Puyallup, WA",8/21/2017,5.0,We were the party of 7 so the wait was long but it was worth it!The drinks were good. I ordered grapefruit scratch sEverything tastes very good. Must eat cornbread! Also crab dip and black chicken. The waitress is very nice and attentive. Our plates were dirty but she was quick to apologize and change them. Highly recommend!
Tulshi P.,"Iselin, Woodbridge Township, NJ",6/4/2017,3.0,"I had come across this restaurant when I was searching for places to eat in the DC area and it had so many reviews! So I wanted to try it out while visiting for the weekend. I made reservations for 5:45pm on a Saturday because they didn't have anything until 8:30pm. Anyways, I get there at 5:30pm and end up waiting till 6pm to get a table. It basically made no sense to make reservations. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli which was a mistake. Initially I ordered the mushroom meatloaf and then changed my mind and asked the waiter for the ravioli instead. They were able to make the change since the food had not been prepared yet. Anyways, I should have probably stuck with the meatloaf because I ended up getting 8 raviolis!! 8 raviolis is hardly anything and I ended up leaving hungry. My friend ordered the same dish and she also only got 8 raviolis. I'm not sure if I would give this place a shot again but if I were to come back I would never order the raviolis. It's pointless. They taste great but the portion needs to be larger for the price you are paying. The service was also not that great. Our waiter seemed like he did not want to be bothered by anything."
Kaitlin N.,"Chicago, IL",2/24/2017,4.0,"Great spot for brunch/ breakfast! I tried both the strawberries & cream French toast which is stuffed with vanilla cream and topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream! I loved the texture/ shape of the French toast.I also tried the crab Benedict which was decent, but tasted a little off compared to other Benedict! The crab still tasted very fresh though."
Courtney A.,"Woodbridge, VA",9/10/2017,5.0,Awesome place for brunch. Chicken and waffles are BOMB! Bartenders are great! The devil-ish eggs appetizer is a must try!
Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",1/24/2017,4.0,"I was actually staying in Tysons Corner, but somehow we were able to get a reservation for the D.C. location, but not the Tysons location. Thank god my team is awesome and didn't mind driving into D.C. just to try this place for breakfast.We made a reservation for 12 people for 9:30am on a Friday. Two more people ended up coming, but the restaurant was able to squeeze in two more chairs at our long table no problem. They seated us after about 9 of our party arrived. At that time, the entrance was crowded with people waiting for a table, but I overheard the average wait time was only quoted at 15 min.I was torn between getting the carrot cake pancakes and the chicken and waffles. I ended up choosing the pancakes. Thanks Ben for pushing me to choose the carrot cake pancakes. So glad I did. The pancakes were fluffy and you could still see the shreds of carrots. Thankfully, they weren't too sweet, but still flavorful enough that you didn't need to eat it with syrup. They give you a dollop of cream cheese butter in the middle, which seemed kind of small for the 3 large head-sized pancakes. Only negative thing is I think it could have used more raisins. If they had also added walnuts, this would have been perfect.I got a side of the leek hash browns in addition to my pancakes. They were pretty standard hash browns. Definitely needed more leeks and they weren't as crispy as I thought they would be. I had a bite of my friend's chicken and waffles. The flavor of the waffles were amazing. I don't think it needs syrup at all. The chicken came in the form of chicken tenders, which were a little bit on the bland side. I thought the white gravy was also kind of bland and badly needed salt.I'm kind of bummed I didn't get to try their skillet cornbread since they only serve it after 11am.  I was able to browse through their recipe book nailed down on a stand next to our table to see how they made it. Still, I hope I get a chance to come back to D.C. to try it."
Fallyn G.,"Washington, DC",2/20/2017,4.0,"Founding Farmers is the orignal restaurant in the Farmers group of restaurants in the DC area. The concept of from farm to table is great for those looking for a ""fresh"" bite to eat. Although I hadn't been to Founding Farmers in a couple of years I was greatly impressed this time around. My food was delicious and at the end of our meal my plate was clean. It was a first for many of the guest at the table but they also truly enjoyed their food. The only adjustment one would have to make would be to the drink options. Since everything is made fresh, it isn't your average soda drink. I say get a classic cocktail, water or be open to a new drink. Ps. The chicken & waffles, mac and cheese and brussel sprouts are a must!If you are looking for a chain of restaurants with organic food, a vibrant atmosphere, great dinner experience for small or large groups then check out Founding Farmers, Farmers Fisher Bakers and Farmers Distillers. #outwiththeneighbors#fallysfoodieexcursions#livelaughloveatgoodfood"
Tiffany H.,"Berkeley, CA",6/4/2017,3.0,"Don't think this place is all that it is hyped up to be, except maybe for the fried tomatoes. Their waiting system sucks, and I had a terrible experience. We put our name down, and they told us that they would text us when our table was ready and that it would be about 45 minutes. Also, another employee asked us for our name and party number again when we were outside waiting. I don't understand why we were asked again when we had already told someone else. They need to have a better system for communication among the employees. When our table was ready, we did not receive a text, and apparently they had called my name, but we missed it, and had to wait even longer. The total wait time ended up to be more like an hour and a half.The black pepper wings is absolutely amazing, and I highly recommend this appetizer! The sweetness of the glaze and the savoriness is well balanced with the proportions of meat on the wings. Must get. The fried green tomatoes were surprisingly delicious. I thought the tomatoes would taste soggy, but they were crisp inside and crunchy outside. I loved the green sauce, and it paired very well with the tomatoes. Not a fan of goat cheese, so didn't like the other sauce.I ordered the breakfast chicken and waffles, but service messed up and gave me the lunch/dinner one. I told them about the mix up, but said it was fine and just ate what they gave me. The mac and cheese was very delicious, not too heavy but cheesy and very American at the same time. The green beans were alright as well. They only served half of a waffle, but the dish is very filling. The waffle was light, airy, and crispy, but the chicken was dry and not phenomenal. Also, the servers did not give me syrup with my waffles, so I had to grab it from the table beside mine. What is up with this???tdlr; not up to the hype, don't think it's that special, you can live without trying"
Ann M.,"Jupiter, FL",8/18/2017,5.0,"Honestly, this is one of my favorite places in DC. I went to brunch and had coconut green tea, blueberry butter pancakes and my mom had waffles with strawberries and cream. It was amazing. Recently my boyfriend and his dad went they loved the food as well."
Lauren G.,"Fairfax, VA",1/25/2017,5.0,MAKE RESERVATIONS WAY AHEAD OF TIME. This place is amazing and because of that extremely popular. You must plan ahead. This place isn't the #1 most requested Lyft stop in D.C. for nothing!Brunch: I split the stuffed bananas foster with my friend and I also got the eggs benedict which was amazing and actually cost around $9 which was cheaper than my cocktail! I got a strawberry cocktail which was good but I like their homemade lemonade more. Dinner: I got the goat cheese ravioli which came with chicken on top of butternut squash puree. The raviolis were tender and the cheese was perfectly melty. The chicken was moist and it all was tied together well with fresh herbs and the squash.
Whitley D.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/6/2017,3.0,"The food was pretty good -  I ordered they're french toast with a side of scrambled eggs. I thought that their french toast was ok with the batter, but it came out looking so plain- no butter on top or a little powdered sugar so the presentation was definitely not on point. The eggs were cool, they came out warm - not fresh. The over all service is the reason why this place gets the 3 stars. They were  NOT on it. They messed up our order and had us waiting a little while. If it weren't for the mediocre service and luke warm  food, the place would be excellent."
Diana C.,"Raleigh, NC",8/22/2017,5.0,"Lord have mercy. After discovering this eatery my first evening in DC, I wanted to eat every meal there during my stay. Not possible. But I will definitely be returning to both DC and Founding Farmers-DCI ordered a Sidecar at the bar where I sat for dinner, and had high expectations after watching the barkeep expertly put together amazing drinks for others. My expectations were met, the drink was perfectly balanced, and the sugared rim was perfect. I proceeded to order a steak and blue cheese salad for dinner. Seriously the best salad I have ever had. Steak salad that is. It was so chock-full of texture, flavors, color; the taste of every item was there individually as I consumed it dreading the end of the experience. I would've ordered a second one if I could've handled that much food. Second time (and last for now) was just as good. I ordered a house cocktail, Farmer Jon, which is the whiskey version of the sidecar, so I loved it too. Ate the Butternut Squash Mascarpone Ravioli. Just thinking about it makes me salivate. Y'all, this stuff is divine food."
Bria S.,"San Jose, CA",6/1/2017,4.0,"This place wasn't too bad. As an out of towner visiting my sister, she was nice enough to take me here. Be prepared to wait for awhile even on a weeknight. It was only the two of us, so we didn't mind sitting at the bar.I was in the mood for a sweet, alcoholic drink. My sister and the bartender recommended El Presidente, which I didn't fancy too much. It had lime, rum and pineapple in it, which wasn't good to my taste buds. But I at least finished the majority of it.I ordered the Meatloaf dinner w/ a choice of 2 sides. I got mac n' cheese with Red Skinned Mashed Potatoes. PRETTY good stuff! Although I'm not a fan of mushrooms (which was cooked inside the Meatloaf) it was still pretty good, moist and flavorful. Our bartender was sweet. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back to this place especially since their menu has something for almost everyone :-)"
Tamika K.,"Fishers, IN",2/4/2017,4.0,To start make reservations!!! It was a huge line when we got here and I think they said the wait was an hour and forty five minutes but we had reservations.  We were sat about 15 minutes after our reservations but it was worth the weight. I started off with a Bellini and beignets which were both delicious. We had a party of 10 and all got something different so I tried a little of every thing. My favorites were the shrimp and grits and the French toast.  Delicious. The beignets were really good light and airy. The red velvet pancakes were very good as well. I really think you can't go wrong. Come to enjoy and our waiter was great. Thanks Kenneth for taking care of our busy crazy table.
Joyce A.,"Gainesville, VA",5/27/2017,4.0,"My friends and I came here for brunch as our last activity at the end of my bachelorette weekend in D.C. The place was pretty crowded since it was a Sunday, but we were able to be seated at our reservation time.We had a great meal here. I decided on the chicken & waffles, my favorite brunch food! It was so delicious and satisfying. My food was so filling. I was so full, but I had to have every bite! It was so good! We had such a great time here. I'm so glad we went here for brunch!"
Holly E.,"Kansas City, MO",8/9/2017,5.0,We stopped for breakfast and on recommendation of waiter I chose the farmers salad as my side... I pretty much want salad with my meat and eggs for breakfast forever now!
Qichelle M.,"Manhattan, NY",7/11/2017,5.0,"Was visiting D.C. for the weekend and I'm so glad I came here.We booked a table for brunch and when we got there we were seated immediately. The service was incredible, our waiter was super attentive and personable. She welcomed every question and gave great recommendations. The menu is a bit busy so I asked what the crowd favorite was and our waiter told us that it was the chicken & waffles, so we went ahead and ordered them. The food came in no time and let me tell you..... it was sooooo good. I've had my fair share of chicken & waffle plates and these were up there with some of the best that I've ever had. It came with a hearty serving of mac & cheese and green beans, which were great--felt like an actual meal (instead of just being served a piece of chicken on a waffle, like most places). My boyfriend ordered the same thing, loved it as well. We practically cleaned our plates. Also guilty of ordering a extra side of mac & cheese because it was THAT good and my boyfriend ordered an extra side of waffles. I recommend this place to anyone visiting D.C looking for a great brunch spot!"
Philip L.,"Fort Worth, TX",6/23/2017,4.0,Great place but beware of the lines to this establishment. Fairly clean and small bathroom. Waiters and waitresses look a bi flustered from the amount of people that come in and out. I don't blame them. But they do handle the crowds well here and a smile is always greeted when served. I like to try a few more things on the menu but I might not wait in the lines again. Lol
Brennan L.,"Irvine, CA",1/15/2017,3.0,"It's weird: I'm glad Founding Farmers exists, but I don't think it's very good. Maybe it's not meant to be. It's an institution in D.C.; does it need to be anything more?My sister and I had brunch reservations for 10:30 on a Friday. We must have gotten there at an off-peak hour, because it was veeery quiet for a place of its reputation. We were happy because it would probably mean quick service, but that was definitely not the case. Our waiter was working on his best Hayden Christensen circa Star Wars Episode II impression and felt really out of place in the otherwise warm atmosphere. He wasn't very attentive and later rushed us out when the lunch crowd started pouring in, so poor marks overall for him.But whatever, the food is what we all come for, right? Founding Farmers is okay in this department, but nothing was memorable. We ordered the pastrami hash, the chicken & waffle, and red velvet pancakes to share. My friends had really hyped the pancakes to me, but I didn't find them special. The hash was pretty pastrami-deficient, but the chicken & waffle was probably the best of the three dishes. We didn't finish everything, but if we could, we wouldn't.Even though my experience was just okay at Founding Farmers, I get it, I appreciate it, and I'll let others fill up its interior while I try other places in the future."
Ndaa H.,"Chicago, IL",8/21/2017,5.0,The crab Benedict with hash browns were delicious. I also got the mocha and it was the perfect morning starter. The staff is super friendly and the setup/environment is very relaxed and laid back. I'll definitely be coming back.
Matt F.,"San Antonio, TX",6/16/2017,5.0,"I order a glass of whiskey, a dark ale, glass of water, and hot wings and all four showed up at the same time. No, the drink order wasn't slow, it's as if they knew I was getting the wings and started them when I walked in the door.   This place was packed, full of life and people having great conversations and big loud laughs. The Founding Farmers is a great place for anyone, as long as your ready for it to be a little on the loud side. Great times."
Stephen D.,"Washington, DC",6/7/2017,3.0,"Really OverhypedYet good for drinks and snackumsCome here for popcornI have been here multiple times, with multiple different groups of people (just two and more intimate and with friends) and, although it is good, this place is definitely way over rated and not worth the price.The food is fresh and decently cooked, but as a sit down meal, I would give it two stars.  Nothing I got except the corn bread and the mousse made me think this place deserved any reputation, and the main course is what matters at dinner.As a bar and late night casual spot, I would give this place four or even five stars.  The appetizers, desserts, popcorn, and drinks are all good, and later at night it is not too crowded, so going out with just a few friends here is definitely a combination for a good time.Overall, decent place and might return for late night drinks when convenient but not for dinner."
Lauren L.,"York, PA",7/16/2017,5.0,"Love love love this place. I thought we made it in time for breakfast but we didn't so we ordered lunch instead.The only thing I didn't like was the Irish coffee. Yikes. Not good.I ordered butternut squash ravioli which had so much flavor and was absolutely delicious.My boyfriend ordered a turkey sandwich which has fresh pulled turkey. Not the crappy meat slices. Also, very good.The atmosphere is nice. A little crowded when waiting for a table. Highly recommend making a reservation!"
Rachel L.,"New York, NY",2/21/2017,4.0,"This place was highly recommended to us by various co-workers - it is so popular that we were only able to score 9am reservations on a Sunday! We arrived 10 mins past 9am and the restaurant was buzzing with activity. We were glad to be shown to a table upstairs, where things were calmer.I was intrigued by some of the sweet items on the brunch menu e.g. carrot cake pancakes, red velvet pancakes, the French toast stuffed with vanilla pastry cream and topped with fruits etc... However, I felt like having something savory and ended up with scrambled eggs hah. I actually ordered the sausage, mushroom & spinach pan scramble but was served the roasted vegetable pan scramble instead. I only realised after taking a few bites - by then, I was enjoying the flavors of the onion, carrot, broccoli, bell pepper and spinach with the egg and so did not bother to send it back to the kitchen. You get a choice of bread and one side - I picked the English muffin and fresh fruits. The former was just ok - just a little too toasted so it lost some of its softness. There was a good variety of fruit - apple, rock melon, strawberry and grapes.I also tried my friend's breakfast chicken & waffles with scrambled eggs and white gravy. This was wildly popular (evident from other Yelpers' reviews) but I thought it was just average. The white gravy seemed tasteless and I've had better scrambled eggs elsewhere.The star of our brunch was the beignets! They are totally worth waking up early for! The menu states that it serves 2-3 but that really depends on how many you'd like to eat. For $8, you get 6 beignets and they were served with raspberry, chocolate and caramel sauces. We actually did not eat the beignets until we were almost done with our own brunch mains, and they still tasted fantastic. They outside was crispy but it was pillowy on the inside and went perfectly with all three sauces. As good as they were, we were stuffed and could not finish the beignets. Our server packed the leftovers for us, together with the sauces. Amazingly, they still tasted great when we had them in the evening!"
Theresa E.,"Monroe, NC",5/15/2017,5.0,"What an amazing restaurant! This is some of the best fried chicken I have ever had and the sides are spectacular.It's important to know up front that you need to make a reservation, as this place is very popular. We waited about a half hour to be seated, despite having a reservation. However, it was well worth the wait and I would do it again!We started with the Bread, Crisps & Chips appetizer and the Devilish Eggs.  Both were a delight.  The dips that come with the bread are all tasty and the serving size is just right for a table of three/four.  For the main course, I ordered one of their specialty sodas, the Chicken & Waffles with the mac & cheese and green bean sides.  All i can say is WOW!  The chicken was amazing.  Super crispy outside and moist & juicy. Its been a week since i had it and i still think about it! The sides were well cooked and incredibly flavorful.  I cant remember what my companions had but they both were as impressed as i was.  I highly recommend this restaurant and i'll definitely return the next time that Im in DC!"
Myles C.,"Philadelphia, PA",1/22/2017,4.0,"I was here for dinner during the inauguration weekend, and like many people have already said: get a reservation. We ended up eating dinner at 4:45 PM. Their cornbread is a good way to start the meal, and if it's the appropriate time of day, a cocktail isn't bad either as they have a fully-stocked bar. I had the fish of the day cooked meuniere-style, and with a side of whipped potatoes and seasonal escabeche. My friend had the scallops meuniere with risotto. Get the scallops, man. The salmon was well-cooked, couldn't tell how fresh it was, but the seasoning was good and the roasted lemon on the side was a nice touch. Note that the escabeche side is served cold, because I had no idea. The whipped potatoes were smooth and buttery. All of the sides tasted very fresh. HOWEVER, the scallop risotto was better and I was jealous of what she had ordered tbh. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the risotto complemented them very effectively. Don't make my mistake; order the scallop risotto. The service was fast and friendly, and the atmosphere lively. It's a great place to have a somewhat upscale dinner that doesn't act at all pretentious."
Brian S.,"Kennesaw, GA",8/3/2017,4.0,"Alright, let's get to the nitty gritty. Big shout out to Luis, our server. I ordered a ribeye steak and upon taking my first bite, it was as hard as a leather shoe. Dry and overcooked. Nothing like a juicy, moist, desirable ribeye that everyone seeks after. Anyways, tried to eat through it, so I ate like 1/3 of the steak and I just couldn't keep chewing this shoe-like texture. So, I told Luis it was dry and hard and he said he can make a new one and Voila. A perfectly cooked steak.Decor is good. Ambiance is good. Took off a star because the steak obviously didn't come out cooked correctly the first time."
Yuhan P.,"Boyds, MD",5/13/2017,3.0,"I've heard a lot of good things about Founding Farmers, and I'm finally here! Arrived around 9am without a reservation, we sat at the bar.The menu doesn't look too special, with typical brunch food such as eggs, pancakes and waffles. I ordered chicken and waffle, which turned out to be a typical average chicken and waffle...not as good as a lot of ones I had before.My brother ordered pan scramble with sausage, spinach and mushroom. However, this dish looks average and tastes below average for me...Since we sat at the bar, the bartender was busy multitasking and forgot to give us forks and knifes, but he was friendly and tried his best to help all the customers.In all, I think this place is an okay average brunch place, and I'm a little bit disappointed because I came with high expectations."
The Denius J.,"Anaheim, CA",9/14/2017,1.0,"We waited an hour to get a corner of a table and when I asked if we could move down to use the other end of the table, they started pointing fingers at each other and told me I could go back on the waiting list. I already waited an hour... at this point, I kinda want to leave but we were a couple miles from our hotel and we were hungry. Then, a little greeter dude that looked about 17 told me to move my backpack because he needed the chair so I asked him if I should wear the backpack while I ate and he shrugged his shoulders and took the chair. I ended up sitting there with my backpack on. After a few seconds, I was so angry I got up to leave. When our server saw this she asked what happened. She got upset that this happened and got the manager. He moved us to another table and said that the little greeter dude shouldn't have spoken to us like that. Oh really? He convinced us to stay but I don't know how good the food will taste now that I'm pretty pissed off. At the end of the day, the manager gave us a few extra appetizers and was very apologetic. He made us feel a little better. He did the best he could with crappy situation that little dude created. Then, while we were eating, that little greeter dude gave us a few smirks as he walked by. Clearly he didn't feel like he did anything wrong. Maybe some retraining is in order for the little guy. Perhaps a new career choice for the little guy?  It sucks that an experience at a nice place like this could be completely ruined by the most insignificant employee there. I'm never coming back here."
David L.,"Castro Valley, CA",6/25/2017,4.0,"This place was suggested by a local and I've learned over the years to take their suggestions to heart and this was no different.  Was in town for my daughter's high school graduation and was looking for a place to have dinner by where we were staying.  Made reservations a couple of days earlier and we were set.  After a pass by of the White House, we went to FF.  Got there about 15 minutes prior to our reservation and it was packed.  The guy checked us in and we waited outside.  Around our reservation time, the hostess came out to seat us.  After we were seated, our waiter came by, introduced himself and gave us the menu and evening specials.I had the short rib and it was very delicious.  Had a nice sweet sauce to it and it fell off the bone without use of a knife.  It came with two sides, in which I had potato salad and spinach, both of which was very tasty.  For dessert, I split the chocolate mousse cake with my daughter.  Good thing, because it was very rich and it was a good size.  Plus, it came with a scoop of strawberry ice cream. Others in the party had chicken pot pie (very puffy top), evening special fish, seafood pasta, yankee pot roast.  Everyone liked what they got.Overall it was a good place to go to, if you want delicious food in a casual atmosphere, this is the place.  Local recommendations never fail....."
Jenny H.,"San Mateo, CA",8/22/2017,3.0,"It's alright. Nothing to rave about. Had the vegetables pan scramble with grits and toast. The scramble was watery due to spinach which is understandable but unappetizing at the same time to eat watery eggs. My companions had the strawberries and cream waffle which she liked and the FF Breakfast with scrambled eggs, pork sausage, and ciabatta with butter which he liked as well. So, all in all it's ok. Service was fine too as standardized."
Daniel M.,"Miami, FL",8/27/2017,5.0,"Simply SPECTACULAR!!! Immaculate service, I highly recommend to make a reservation, I was a walk in customer and my waiting time was one hour, I went to the bar and ordered there. We ordered the Shrimp & Lobster Risotto and the Chicken bolognese Bucatini, like magic in your mouth!!! I'LL BE BACK FOR SURE"
Rachel H.,"Marlow Heights, MD",7/21/2017,5.0,"We stopped in on a Friday morning for breakfast after making a reservation the night before. Although the place wasn't super busy I'm glad we made a reservation. There's two floors but we were seated on the first floor at a high top. I was really impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and the simplicity of the decor. Every staff we interacted with was friendly and the sever offered suggestions on what to order. Their breakfast menu has; stuffed French toast, waffles, pancakes, benedicts, scrambles, hash, and more. We both decided on pancakes and a side. The pancakes themselves are between $7-9 and seemed worth it. I wish they would've came with the side but it wasn't too expensive to add one. The bacon (which comes in multiple flavors) was super good and the right amount of crispy! Okay back to the pancakes, the regular buttermilk $7 come with three large pancakes. They tasted excellent, super fluffy and piping hot! I hate when pancakes have cooled down by the time they get to the table. We also ordered the banana foster pancakes $9 and they were awesome! I couldn't even finish them they were so big. The leek hashbrowns were super tasty too and I would order them again. This place is really great and welcoming, I can't wait to go back."
Patty C.,"Tampa, FL",8/3/2017,5.0,"Why 5 stars? Because despite its insane popularity they are prompt and honor reservation times and have quick turnover with tables. Their service is wonderful, and our server took her time to discuss the restaurant, answer any questions, inquire about potential allergies, and frequently visited our table to check in. The food is delicious. Although I can't speak for others' in my table, I can say my kale salad was delicious. The large portion is truly large. I also had their fried green tomatoes, which I really liked (although nothing overly different than at other restaurants that feature this on  their menu). Ambience is trendy and fresh, and their bar is always packed! I would happily return, especially to try their brunch."
Gabriel N.,"Union City, CA",12/15/2016,5.0,"Super hyped, but totally worth it. MAKE A RESERVATION UNLESS YOU WANT TO WAIT 5EVERCame in at 7:30am on a Tuesday morning with my coworker. It wasn't too packed and I saw a lot of tables free  We were immediately asked, ""Do you guys have a reservation?"" Of course we didn't. I was like there's so many tables here, but apparently everything was reserved. Luckily, bar seating is open and there were tons of seats at 7:30am. By the time we were finished, the entire restaurant was packed. I can see why people say make a reservation wayyyyyyy in advance. The hostess even told us that wait times are 2-3 hours if you don't have one.I ordered the crab benedict with a side of grits. Man. I scarfed that benedict down so fast. It was pretty much cooked to perfection with a generous amount of crab meat. The grits was also really good. My meal went really well with the natural french press coffee. No cream or sugar needed!Service was amazing. The bartender/waiter kept checking up on us and made sure everything was as we expected. Overall, one of those must go to place while in DC. Did I mention make a reservation?? Unless you're okay with bar seating....MAKE A RESERVATION."
Riddhika J.,"Savage, MD",5/28/2017,2.0,"I was looking for the brunch places in DC to celebrate 30th birthday of our friend and my attention immediately went to founding farmers. With more than 8000 reviews, this place was bound to be impressive or so I thought. I called the restaurant and could only get reservation for 4pm. We were at the restaurant at 3:30 and they were happy to accommodate us little early.Our server was very enthusiastic but it was  obvious that she was handling too many tables and she switched us to different server after taking our drinks order which she had forgotten to pass on to the next server. For drinks, we ordered Fraise Fling ( Refreshing but not too sweet),farmers Smash - Founding Farmers Rye (which was the best drink), Cobbler (which was just ice it appears with lack of any flavor). To go with drinks we ordered Breads, Chips, Crisps which was delicious and the ships were surprisingly crisp and the cheeses were excellent choice for the platter. For main course, we ordered -Yankee Pot Roast (it was delicious and very flavorful)-Goat Cheese Ravioli ( which was way too sweet and very disappointing)-Avocado Bacon Burger* ( the patty was little too dry)-Cranberry & Brie Vegetable Burger (which was deliocious but little dry)Since we had a birthday boy with us, we asked them to serve a Triple Layer Chocolate Mousse Cake with a candle. Since some of us finished out food, they served the cake and we started singing and cutting the piece. When I looked up to the my food it was GONE! I was only half way done with my burger and THE WAITER REMOVED THE PLATE WITH HALF OF MY FOOD WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ONCE!  When I told him that I was still eating, he said "" He is sorry"" and that's it. Is that manner appropriate. He either should have brought me another burger or asked me if wanted anything. I was out of money and still hungry. The food ( the parts I can finish) was great. It would have been much better experience if they weren't in such a hurry to drove us out and hence 2 starts."
Rohit G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",8/21/2017,4.0,This looks pretty upscale with regular breakfast prices. Blueberry pan cakes were really good. Server was super nice and super helpful in ordering. Overall a great place at a great location.
Kyle S.,"Cambridge, MA",7/25/2017,4.0,"This is for Sunday brunch. Really nice brunch but relatively slow service. Fortunately, my friend came in the restaurant earlier in the day and was able to bump our 2 pm reservation to 1:15, so we didn't have to wait in the restaurant for a table.   I never really think of Founding Farmers as ""cheap"" but compared to many DC brunch places, 9 dollars for 2 eggs, a meat, bread, and a side is more than reasonable. While some of the specialty items are marginally more expensive, they're nothing crazy. I ordered the sausage, spinach and mushroom scramble with toast and a salad and my friend ordered the blueberry pancakes. They both felt fresh, flavorful, and ""farm-like."" We did have to ask two times though for the whipped blueberry butter that came with the pancakes and our waitress was slow in bringing waters and the check. However, we were too absorbed in conversation to let it dampen the meal!Founding Farmers has great atmosphere and will almost always be packed on a ""brunch"" day. While it may not be worth a 2 hr wait in the eyes of a local, it's definitely really good food!"
Nicole T.,"Mars, PA",8/20/2017,5.0,"The most amazing waffle I've had in DC!!! This place is prefect for grabbing brunch before heading out monumenting. The food is priced reasonably! They get incredibly busy on the weekends, I would recommend making a reservation on OpenTable. This place would also be great for family with young children. It tends to get very pack so the restaurant is pretty loud, mom & dads won't have to worry about their children being too loud/negatively affecting others."
Candyce B.,"Charlotte, NC",12/12/2016,5.0,"Wow. This place is awesome! Like...really really awesome. I came here for my birthday dinner and it was so much better than I expected. The service, food and drinks were all spot on. This place stays busy but I completely understand why...and trust me it's worth the wait. To start we ordered the glazed bacon lollies and skillet cornbread. The lollies were so good I forgot to take a picture. I mean what's not to love about bacon with a sweet but not overpowering coating. I seriously could have ordered a second round. Next up was the cornbread also very yummy and backed with flavor. For my meal I ordered the Scallops Meuniere which comes with butternut risotto. Wow. The scallops were seasoned well and cooked perfectly and the risotto was the perfect compliment. I'd order this again and again. Of course we had to have dessert and they had one of my absolute favorites - beignets! Ah they are cooked up fresh, so make sure to order them when your food arrives so that you have enough time to enjoy your meal and these goodies. They come with three dipping sauces a chocolate, carmel and raspberry. My favorite hands down was the raspberry. If you're in the area this is definitely a place you should check out! I'm such a huge fan!"
B A.,"Chicago, IL",9/10/2017,4.0,"The food is fine, the upstairs is nice and quiet (downstairs is loud), service is good, but I don't get what the fuss is about -- it's not blowing other places in DC out of the water by any means. We had a reservation and though it was insanely crowded they seated us pretty quickly which I appreciated. Some of the brunch menus are kind of over priced for the amount of food you get (and same for tea and coffee). The best deal for brunch is the ham and eggs. Everything I got tasted good, but i wish they didn't have such low quality protein options in their standard menu- my fellow brunchers were not so lucky with their choices. glad i went once but probably won't feel the need to go again soon."
A M.,"Milwaukee, WI",8/9/2017,5.0,Great restaurant and service. Visiting DC and wanted to try this place due to the great reviews. Next time I'm in DC I will definitely come back. Try the Dark and Stormy with your meal.. it's refreshing and delicious!
Angel K.,"Washington, DC",7/30/2017,4.0,"Good food, but mediocre service. This place was pretty busy and our table had to ask for silverware/napkins. Our starting order of breads were exceptional, an explosion of flavor in each bite. Our main dishes were solid. I enjoyed the short clean pot pie, the scallop dish was tasteful and mushroom Rueben were good. Sadly the mac and cheese was quite disappointing, similar to a hot food line from a cafeteria- I'd recommend against it.  Great variety of drinks. I would come back for another meal."
Ashley H.,"Bunker Hill, WV",7/6/2017,5.0,"I'm starting off with the service. My server, Lilly, was fantastic. I came to Founding Farmers to celebrate, and Lilly not only asked what I was celebrating, but when I told her she then gave me a free dessert. How cool is that? She was attentive, personable, and she didn't once get frustrated when I asked one of the many annoying questions I had. We even bonded over where I was coming to D.C. from!Now, onto the good stuff: the food. I started with the pesto bread. And my oh my was it tasty. A little sweet. A little tart. And topped with a delicious tomato. The bread was even good!For my entree I had the shrimp and lobster risotto. The mushrooms weren't for me because I don't like mushrooms but the shrimp and lobster? I thought I died and went to heaven. It was so good, and not at all like the stuff you'd get from a chain restaurant. And the risotto was, I would say, the food equivalent of Lularoe leggings. Buttery. Tasty. Smooth.And finally, the dessert: red velvet cake. I forced myself to eat it because I was so full. And it was so worth it. The cream cheese frosting was neither too sweet nor too cream cheesy. The perfect balance. And the cake itself was delicious - not at all dry. Chocolaty, but not too chocolaty.All of that being said, between the food and the service, I highly recommend this place. And ask for Lilly! She was such a great server and made the 30 minute wait totally worth it."
Danielle K.,"Santa Monica, CA",12/5/2016,4.0,"What a fantastic place I discovered! I was visiting Washington DC for the weekend and decided to Yelp some restaurants before my actual trip in order to make reservations in advance. This is one of the top choices that came up so after I read through the reviews and looked through the pictures, I was set! Making a reservation was easy and I highly suggest it as it was crazy busy when we got there for brunch on a Sunday. I would say at least 50 people waiting for a table. Also be sure to show up on time for your reservation as they have a very short graze period before your table is given away.We were seated towards the back in a cute little table for two. The menus were presented instantly as well as water to drink. Huge plus for leaving a jug of water on the table for us to refill ourselves...I wish more restaurants would do this! We scoured through the menus and decided to get some things from both the breakfast menu and the lunch menu. I settled on the Maple Cinnamon Butter Waffle with eggs on the side while my boyfriend got a sandwich (can't remember the name) and chose to split sliders as an appetizer. We also both ordered lemonades. The food came out fairly fast for the amount of people in the restaurant. I wasn't impressed with the sliders however the waffle was the most delicious thing EVER! The lemonades were fantastic as well. Will definitely be back next time I am in town!"
Ondrea T.,"Pearland, TX",7/30/2017,2.0,"Eh. The restaurant was hyped so much I expected more. They were very sparing with the alcohol in my drink and the food was just ok. I got the skillet cornbread (good but mushy in the middle), the fried green tomatoes  (slightly tasteless), and the chicken and waffles (chicken: dry waffle: cold) but i can't be too heavy handed with this review because i  from the south and know what southern fare should taste like. If this is all DC can do then they have made a respectable effort."
Catherine S.,"Waldorf, MD",5/22/2017,5.0,"I'm always so excited to dig into this food that I forget to take pictures for my review.  I will be able to restrain myself to snap a quick pic one of these days!  This place never disappoints.  My husband and I frequent here for date nights and the whole experience is always great. They are busy and it's best to make a reservation.  I've never just walked in so I can't speak about how long the wait would be...we always use opentable.com to make a reservation. We don't drink alcohol but we always get a house made from scratch soda.  I usually get vanilla soda and my husband most recently got ginger soda.  They usually have four or five to choose from one being a seasonal flavor.  They have great appetizers to choose from and we usually get the flat bread and they have five or so flavors to choose from.  We get the Brie with pears and it is soooo good.  It is a good portion and plenty for 2 people to share.  We've tried numerous different main courses and you really can't go wrong with any of them.  Chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, pot roast, steaks, sandwiches, burgers, salads...it's all good!  Everything is pretty affordable as well.  They have staple sides but they also change a few out seasonally as well.We will continue coming back here for our occasional date night.  We've been here for breakfast one time and that was amazing as well!"
Aurelia S.,"Washington, DC",8/23/2017,2.0,"Large group visiting from California wanted to go to dinner.  There's lots of vegetarians in the group, so someone booked us here.  So overrated!  The food was very meh and very expensive.  I had some type of veggie burger that was so poorly done, it basically turned into mush on a bun, and it wasn't even tasty mush on a bun.On top of that, the waitress added $10 to my credit card when she processed it (I leave cash tips), which I didn't discover until my credit card bill arrived a month later and didn't match my receipt."
Vanessa C.,"Hyattsville, MD",9/10/2017,4.0,"I had the bacon wrapped, blue cheese stuffed dates, the brie farm bread, the blue cheese bacon burger with fries, a glass of white wine, and then some Arnold Palmers and the hibiscus soda. ALL the food was delicious and I highly recommend each dish. Aside from the wine, I didn't care for the drinks. The regular Arnold Palmer wasn't sweet enough, the sweet tea Arnold Palmer was too sweet (had to add water), and the hibiscus soda was fine but didn't taste like hibiscus.The service was great, decor was beautiful, and the upstairs seating is nice as there's a lot of bustle downstairs. The items are also very reasonably priced.Only bummer was when I opened my take home container the next day, I saw that only my burger was included but not the fries, which I wanted. Don't know if that's typical but since I asked for extra sauce for the fries (which they gave me), I figure it was just an oversight. Will check next time, though.Great job, guys! Love the place and will definitely be going back."
Weston G.,"Ventura, CA",8/22/2017,5.0,"OH MY GOD literally one of the best meals of my life, I had the chicken and waffles which comes with a surprise side of perfectly scrambled eggs which was a nice touch. The waffle was divine, light and fluffy just as it should be and the chicken was seasoned well, not too strongly so that it overwhelmed the palette, the flavors simply harmonized together. Even the coffee was great, it tasted as though it came from a craft coffee shop instead of the usual diner taste. Some bonus details: the price of this place is incredible, I spent about $20 including tip and tax and wouldve paid quite a bit more for this meal! Also a reservation is absolutely necessary"
Prarthana P.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",5/7/2017,5.0,On our family weekend getaway to D.C. I had this place on my to go list. The food and service was worth the hype! One of the best in D.C for sure. Loved the fried green tomatoes! I had chicken and waffles. The portion was too big for one person! Glad me & my husband decided to share. He loved it too! My mum ordered a roasted veggie scrambled egg with a side of fruits. The veggies were fresh and crunchy! Cocktail and beer selections were vast and we loved the ones we ordered! Founding Farmers I'm coming back for you soon!
Dennis W.,"Azusa, CA",11/20/2016,3.0,"It started with a reservation, but we were left waiting for 28 minutes.  Like hounds to a tree-bound raccoon, we found the bar. Only two vodkas to wet our whistles; Tito's or Absolute.  I felt like a fox sneaking into an empty chicken coop. I was excited, salivating, and then, WHAM; disappointment.  This prohibition-style bar is traditional, but barely satisfying for us vodka snobs. Up the steps we went as the noise from other patrons grew softer and softer: sit upstairs for a more intimate dining experience. Out came the recommended appetizers: cornbread and seafood deviled eggs. The cornbread was moist and had lots of kernels inside, but the deviled eggs about gave me a heart attack. I clenched my chest and said, ""Me left ventricle"" as the strong, overwhelming, taste of salt filled my mouth. Surely the next egg would be better.  I kept the next egg in my mouth and resisted the urge to spit it out by washing it down with some water. The server offered to remake the dish, but I politely declined.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. The ribeye was decent and the price was very reasonable. It was prepared a perfect medium with a solid, but not great, seasoning. It's a ""safe"" entre, but didn't have any wow effect or flare. Packed was this restaurant and I was surprised since the food was so-so and didn't provide.  I'm traveling or I'd give them another chance, but why not give a great first impression?"
Kim M.,"Schaumburg, IL",8/13/2017,4.0,While in DC for a girls weekend we dined at Founder Farmers. My tastebuds and wallet were pleasantly surprised with this little gem. I had the chicken pot pie for dinner and it was heavenly. It arrived with a perfect flaky dome of crust that melted in my mouth. The gravy was rich and filled with veggies. My only wish was that it had a bit more chickenOthers in my group had the rotisserie chicken with the drip pan potatoes. I was told the chicken was moist and the potatoes were to die for. Another person had the grilled cheese and said it was delicious. Prices were good for D.C. and there was a variety of dishes from which to pick.
Alex C.,"Vancouver, Canada",12/28/2016,4.0,"We made a reservation at 6:00 pm. We had to wait around 20 minutes to actually get a table. The family who sat next to us had a 5:45 pm reservation and was seated only at around 6:25 pm. Our first aborted attempt to dine at this restaurant was on Christmas Day, where no walk ins were accepted. If you want to eat here, make an reservation.Ambiance was good. Service was excellent. Food came very quickly. The washroom had this foot door opener, which I thought was awesome for hand hygiene.As for the food, it was very good. The Farmhouse Platter was very filling. The Chicken and Waffles were very good. I liked the mac and cheese that came with it.You'd expect to pay an arm and a leg for such a dining experience, but it's very affordable. This is likely why this place is always so busy. Great place to take a date. I wholeheartedly approve."
Komal K.,"Philadelphia, PA",5/14/2017,4.0,"We came here on Mother's Day Sunday without a reservation and there was a one hour wait at 11:30 am. There's a lot of waiting space outside, not so much inside so be prepared. They do however send you a text once your table is close to getting ready so you can make your way to your food. Once inside, service is good and fast. We ordered fried green tomatoes, bacon lollies and skillet corn bread for appetizers. Everything was delicious. Vegetarian burger was good but nothing to rave about. Chicken pot pie was comforting. This place has some really good drink options. All of their cocktails were good. Overall I totally understand the wait and the hype. Would definitely recommend."
PJ C.,"Rochester, NY",4/21/2017,3.0,"We were excited to dine here on Easter Sunday and the place was packed.  Glad I had made a reservation weeks in advance via Open Table.  Their hostess operation seemed a bit overwhelmed and confused - we discovered later on that they seated us under someone else's reservation and then canceled our's when we did not show up!?Anyway we were escorted to a large upstairs dining room - we loved the decor and vibe of the place.  The menu had so many awesome choices it was hard to select.  We ordered their corn bread and it was by far the finest corn bread we have had especially with the honey butter.  Being big BBQ fans we have had our share of corn bread around the country and this was the best.We also ordered a salad, which was good, but we were not even five bites into it when our entrees showed up.  I know the place was crazy busy but this was ridiculous timing - I guess they really wanted to turn the table.The shrimp and grits with andouille sausage was quite spicy but more of a jambalaya vs the traditional dish.  The meatloaf  with two sides was a big portion and was solid but nothing special.  Their prices were not too bad.  I would return to try out some other items but I would pick a slower time..."

Updated review",4.0,"Came here today for brunch. I accidentally booked a 10pm appointment rather than 10am, however, I was seated promptly! Strawberry Fizz - delicious! Light and flavorful Blueberry pancakes-  aaaauuughhhllll, yessss.Scrambled eggs with cheese - nothing special, save your money.Chicken sausage - meh, nothing special. Salad - yum!Overall, not bad. My server was wonderful."
Kelley B.,"Nashville, TN",8/17/2017,5.0,"Met a friend for dinner here. It was super busy but we managed to find a seat at the bar. We split the deviled eggs (good) and the goat cheese ravioli (excellent). I just wish there was more ravioli on the plate because we ate it too fast. I also ordered the blackberry sour, which was very good but pricey. We had excellent service by the bartender as well."
Tracey BlaqueButterfly G.,"Washington, DC",9/6/2017,2.0,"Food was okay, service was minimal. Nothing like what I've seen or heard about this place."
Victoria M.,"Washington, DC",9/6/2017,5.0,"The strawberries and cream french toast is heaven on earth. That, and a cup of coffee in the morning, will put you right back to sleep, but with a full, happy tummy and ecstatic taste buds."
Cindy M.,"Washington, DC",8/11/2017,4.0,"I've been to both Founding Farmers (this D.C. location and the one in Tysons) and they've both provided similarly great experiences. The food comes in big portions and they're all delicious, so it's definitely worth the price! They have a lot of classic southern foods (cornbread, chicken pot pie, chicken and waffles, etc.), but they also have dishes outside that comfort zone like spicy ahi tuna poke salad (which I love!). Among all the dishes on the menu, I would 100% recommend the cornbread! I, myself, am not a huge fan of cornbread, but this place will change your mind if you have the same sentiment. Despite how busy it gets, the service is pretty good. The waiters are consistently coming around to tables to check up on them and serve food/answer questions. At the bar, you can wait for your table to be open or just eat there as well. The drinks are pretty good, and they don't skimp out on the alcohol! ;) One of the cons of being so popular is obviously the wait time when it comes to the lunch/dinner rush, so you might have to make reservations way ahead of time (sometimes they'll get booked all day during the summer). Other than that, I'll definitely continue being a regular here!"
Byron S.,"McKinney, TX",11/25/2016,5.0,"While in the city, good friends recommended we try this for dinner.  I used Open Table to lock in my reservation and we were seated when we arrived.  Great table overlooking the sidewalk and main dining area.We started with a few drinks and I had The Constitution, awesome flavors.  We selected the bread, chips and dips for appetizer. For main course, we had the chicken pot pie and the pot roast. So much food.  Finally we chose the apple pie and the whole experience was great.  I will return and highly recommend you place them on your future list.  Let me know your thoughts."
Erin E.,"West Henrietta, NY",8/17/2017,5.0,Banana Foster pancakes are a gift to humanity. The atmosphere is accommodating to a variety of preferences. Service quick and good. Did I mention the banana foster pancakes are amazing?!
Jess B.,"Madison Heights, MI",5/5/2017,4.0,"This is a very trendy fun restaurant. They have a variety of dishes on their menu to satisfy the pickiest eater.We arrived at 8:30 in a Thursday evening and the wait was 45 minutes. Whoa! Luckily for us, after 20 minutes we found a couple of seats at the bar and we were able to get full service there.I had chicken and waffles. The waffle and syrup were delicious. It came with green beans and mac and cheese. Both were very good. Now the chicken; it was ok. The seasoning on the batter was good, but the chicken itself was a little dry and tasteless. Not enough to ruin the meal, but still disappointing.Our bar tender/ server was great. Spunky petite lady who could make a good drink! That's where my other negative factor comes in. My meal was $19 and my drink was $14. I felt drinks costing as much as a meal was a little much. Don't get me wrong, the drinks were good and crafted well, but a little pricey. One I had was about 4 sips so I took the tiniest sips so that I could really enjoy my $14!This place was worth going to and would have been worth the full 45 minute wait if need be. Try it!"
Helen P.,"San Francisco, CA",11/26/2016,4.0,"I love the delicious brunch options and phenomenal beignets. I ordered the founding farmer's breakfast (nothing wrong with a simple breakfast) and beignets for sharing. The beignets come with chocolate, caramel, and raspberry dipping sauces. The beignets are crispy on the outside and pillowy/chewy on the inside. You can't come to Founding Farmers and not order a plate of beignets. The brunch cocktails were a bit pricey (around $12 each), but they're very well made. I really enjoyed the Bellini but the Southside was a bit strong for my tastes. Overall, I really enjoyed my brunch experience here and would definitely come back the next time I visit DC."
Melanie W.,"Greensboro, NC",12/29/2016,5.0,"Another great visit! This is a must visit anytime we are in DC. This trip did not disappoint. We ordered the deviled eggs and pickled vegetables for our starters. Both are our favorites! Simple but flavorful. I opted for the chicken and waffles, which is a first for me! I was pleasantly surprised at how good the two together can be! The mac and cheese side is amazingly good and I will definitely order just that next time. I'd also like to try the cornbread too. The chicken was fried perfectly. Crispy and not oily. It had a lot of flavor. The chicken gravy side was quite tasty too. The waffles were good but became super soggy after a while. I also ordered the seasonal escabeche which I was super excited about (Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, carrots and onions) but it was a dud. My bowl was nothing but carrots! My daughter ordered the same thing and she had a good mix of all the veggies. Other entrees ordered were the rice and bean burger with smoked tofu and the seasonal chili (beef, veggies and bacon). Both dishes were delicious and enjoyed! We finished our meal off with the triple layer chocolate mousse cake which was rich and decadent. Perfect end to our meal!"
Libby H.,"Houston, TX",8/16/2017,5.0,Have been waiting to go to this place ever since I knew I was coming to D.C. Did not disappoint at all! I have never gotten any eggs Benedict before but this was such a good place to have it for the first time! I got the tomato florentine eggs Benedict. The flavors of the hollandaise sauce with the juicy tomatoes were so good. Definitely recommend this place! Nice ambiance inside too.
Ashley W.,"Henrico, VA",5/8/2017,2.0,I only gave them two stars because my food was super good but the customer service was not so good my waiters name was Jai let me just say that was the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life.  My friends eggs were not cooked correctly and her waffle wasn't completely done the waiter seemed to have a attitude with her about that. I also ordered a red velvet pancake that never came to the table after my friends food was replaced the waiter never came back to make sure everything was okay and we had to flag her down for our checks. I get home later that night and my card was swiped for the wrong amount! I have so much more to say but I'll just leave it at the food was great for me the farmers breakfast was exactly what I needed but I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon because of the customer service :(
Iris S.,"Ann Arbor, MI",11/19/2016,5.0,"SO good.Chicken and waffles: the chicken was perfectly moist and not overly breaded or fried. It paired really well with the waffles and they give you enough chicken so you're not just left with a waffle by itself. The syrup on the side is also delicious, not too viscous and still sweet. Comes with one side of your choosing and an order of mac and cheese so you'll end up very satisfied if you just order this. Today's fish is also really good. When we went, we got salmon and the skin was cooked really nicely and sweet and the fish was still juicy, not dry. It comes with two sides and I think it's well worth the $24 or however much it is.You definitely want to make a reservation. They have two floors but it still fills us really quickly and there's usually around a 45 minute wait on the weekends."
Lee Roy C.,"Austin, TX",11/1/2016,2.0,"We made a smart decision by calling ahead for a reservation because the line was at least 25 people deep when we arrived. It's a really well-decorated restaurant with a homey/modern feel to it. We decided to split pancakes for the table and went with the bananas foster and blueberry. Both were light and fluffy with delicious fruit toppings. No syrup needed, in my opinion. Unfortunately, the rest of the items I tried were not as good. I went with the pastrami hash, which ended up being extra heavy on the hash. There were maybe 5 small pieces of pastrami mixed into the massive mound of potatoes, so few that I was hesitant to let my friends try my dish or I wouldn't have any meat left. The eggs on top were also a little off. They were somewhere between poached and a McDonald's egg mcmuffin egg. I think the most disappointing dish was my friend's steak and eggs. The steak was way beyond her ordered medium, and it was overly charred on the outside; it literally tasted like charcoal and ash, not exactly appetizing for $14. Fortunately, we were already pretty full from the pancakes."
Erick S.,"Staten Island, NY",6/4/2017,5.0,"If I should start with the bad. We had brunch reservations on a Sunday and still waited around half hour to be seated. But hey, this was all more than worth it. We ordered the corn bread and it was hands down the best we've had. The food was amazing and the staff was very attentive despite how busy the place is. Definitely recommend to make a reservation before you arrive and don't miss if you're in Washington DC."
Dale S.,"San Diego, CA",11/16/2016,4.0,"You know a place is solid when it has over 8k reviews on Yelp with 4 stars! Shoutout to y'all on Yelp, I'm really glad I came across this place for my last brunch in the DC area!The wait here on a Monday morning wasn't too bad at all; my friends and I (party of three) probably waited 10-15 minutes until we were seated. I was really feelin' the vibe and atmosphere of this place -- very modern and nicely decorated! My friends and I first started off with some drinks. I ordered the hot chocolate, which wasn't hot at all, it was more like warm chocolate :( No worries, though! For food, I ordered the sausage, mushroom, and spinach egg dish with fresh fruit and ciabatta bread. Sooo good and the portions were more than generous. My friends and I also split the blueberry pancakes. Delicious as well! Service was also good, and I liked their private bathrooms. :)"
Hannah Y.,"Waterloo, Canada",7/24/2017,3.0,I came here because so saw all the crazy reviews on yelp. I was pretty underwhelmed with the food. We went for brunch at 11 and they did not give us a brunch menu. So we assumed the menu they gave us was brunch. We were hoping for breakfast food but ended up with super heavy options. I got the fried chicken and waffles... I thought the chicken was dry.Wouldn't pay this much for their food. Maybe next time I'll have to go earlier
Pearce D.,"Hoboken, NJ",10/30/2016,5.0,One of my favorite places in DC- simple but not your ordinary place. Great food but more than reasonable prices. Have to recommend the pork chop- amazing flavor and definitely will not be hungry after. In addition with two sides you'll be able to sample quite a bit. DC has a growing food scene but highly recommend you check this out.
Cody M.,"Crownpoint, NM",8/25/2017,5.0,Spectacular restaurant with amazing drinks and food. Had the Meatloaf and Gravy for dinner. The meatloaf came topped with an Au Juo and white gravy. This meatloaf was probably better than moms home cooking. Also had a side of snow peas. I'm not sure what the seasoning was but they were delicious as well.
Arthita G.,"Hyattsville, MD",11/6/2016,4.0,"1) they are good for large groups 2) they are usually crowded so making a reservation ahead of time helps. If you fail to show up on time they hold your reservation for 15min afterward. 3) it's pretty bustling and noisy inside. 4) lots of options for vegetarians 5) food tastes fine, not extremely delicious but not bad either4) service was pretty quick compared to the crowd level5) desserts are huge! The chocolate mousse was the best."
Shavon L.,"Philadelphia, PA",5/11/2017,4.0,"I've been here before and it was fan-tab-ulous! I went back for brunch after visiting an exhibit in D.C. with some girlfriends. There was an hour wait, but we didn't mind much. The restaurant was packed front to back. We were beyond starving. We stopped at the local cvs across the street for a pre-meal of cheese sticks and snickers ice cream bars. Finally, and hour and 10 minutes later, accompanied by two visits to the hostess we were on our way to be seated. Yasssssss!!The upstairs was beautiful, I was seated downstairs prior, but the plates passing by us looked amazing!! Our server, Bernard, was outstanding. Funny, polite, and very knowledgeable about the menu.We started with fried green tomatoes, seafood deviled eggs, and cornbread. Every dish was tasty! I really enjoyed their seasonal drink which was a pineapple, mint spritzer (non-alcoholic). For our entrees I had banana foster waffles and crab Benedict with cheese grits. I can't scream SENSATIONAL loud enough. This is a great place for food, fun, and laughs. I will say the upstairs seating is not very personal. We had to keep our ""adult"" convo limited and censored, due to the cute baby next to us. I am not a coffee drinker, but one of my girlfriends was swooned by the coffee bar they had!! Take out is available. Happy eating!"
Dawn P.,"Washington, DC",8/25/2017,5.0,"From the service to the food to the staff everything in this place was amazing. The drinks were great quality and not skimpy at all. The food was well cooked, spiced and well presented too. I can't wait to go back!"
Charleen S.,"Chesterfield, MO",4/7/2017,4.0,"Not sure why I'm writing this review, since it's basically in line with the consensus of the 8475 other people who've reviewed them, so I'll keep it short...Service was great, we never wanted for anything.  Food was also delicious - real corn in the skillet cornbread, scallops that melt in your mouth, and beignets hot and fresh.  Didn't love the risotto; it was a little too clumpy and had peas in it.  They were out of the wine I wanted.  When I asked for my second choice something occurred to me.  I'm not a ""wine person.""  Realistically, they could have brought me anything red in a wine glass and charged me whatever for it and I probably would have been happy.  I'm sophisticated like that.Pro tip:  Don't even try it unless you either have a reservation or like to hang around in restaurants for long periods of time waiting for a table."

Updated review",5.0,Great environment. Came in here because the name reminded me of the bar on the tv show Bones. The drink was very well crafted and worth the price.
Sabrina V.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",8/3/2017,3.0,"I tried to come here for Breakfast/ Brunch, but I just missed it. So I had the lunch menu instead. I ordered the Skillet Corn Bread and Chicken Pot Pie. The corn bread was so tasty, I loved how it had actual corn in it plus the honey butter, just a perfect match. Definitely a must try. Seeing that the chicken pot pie was one of their signature dishes, I wasn't pleased with it. It just had big chunks of celery and carrots, which I didn't like. I wish they added more chicken, however the soup was good. Lastly, the crust wasn't full baked, mine was still doughy. I wish I had sent it back, I literally picked at my food. However, I would still come back to try their other items."
Jennifer K.,"Jenkintown, PA",4/12/2017,5.0,Omg the beignets! And the waffles were amazing! As always my fellow yelpers led me in the right direction. I needed a great breakfast spot in DC while visiting and I agree that Founding Farmers hit the mark. Everything was tasty and I loved the atmosphere.
Fernando P.,"Tampa, FL",9/2/2017,5.0,Fellow vegans! The mushroom loaf with mashed potatoes is banging. It's totally worth it.
Whitney W.,"Honolulu, HI",8/1/2017,5.0,So good! I got the banana foster french bread. We came again the next day and got the original eggs benedict. Both were delicious and the service wasn't so bad either.
Claude A.,"Somerville, MA",5/25/2017,5.0,"This place has a hip vibe and really good food at reasonable prices.Chicken and waffles: super good, though the chicken pieces were a bit small.Steak and eggs: steak was crazy tender and delicious. The quality of the food for the price was surprising. Great food, great atmosphere, pretty quick service. If I lived in DC, this would be my go-to brunch/breakfast spot."
Quent I.,"Houston, TX",5/23/2017,4.0,"The menu offers a good variety of choices. Drinks are a bit slow to arrive but they have a nice selection. We took the farmhouse platter, excellent, and finished up with desert. Ambiance cute and have a good selection of drinks. Would definitely recommend when passing by D.C. Around Penn ave."
Hayley W.,"Arlington, VA",8/16/2017,3.0,"Delicious, yet extremely over-priced and always super crowded.Maybe a good spot for tourists."
Minji K.,"Aurora, CO",10/24/2016,4.0,"MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A RESERVATION - first time in DC and this place had a 2 hour wait for brunch. This was a good indication that the food must be delicious lol My friends and I hoovered around the bar since it was first come first serve at the bar. Luckily we only waited 15 minutes and we scored some seats at the bar, winning!Our inner fat kid personalities wanted to try everything and ended up ordering - deviled eggs, bacon lollis, freshly squeezed orange juice, ice coffee, regular coffee from the press ($6 for 2 cups vs $4 per cup for regular - this was a no brainier, why not save $2 and get the pressed coffee instead? lol) we also ordered the crab benedict, chicken and waffles, and ham and eggs. Portions are reasonable and not outrageously huge. The chicken and waffles is a must, the chicken is not overly cooked and greasy - it was flavorful and moist. Definitely fell into food coma since we brunched so hard."
Adelyn L.,"New York, NY",4/12/2017,5.0,"If anyone is in DC for a visit, they should definitely check this restaurant out. Wait time is a killer so I highly highly recommend making reservations if possible. I came here once in 2013 and had their fried chicken and waffles along with the deviled eggs. I remember both being really good.Just popped in last weekend for the Cherry Blossom Festival and came for brunch. Waited about 2 hours so I'm glad the food, once again did not disappoint! We ordered a whole bunch of stuff. Here's a short summary:french toast - OMG. BEST french toast EVER. It was crispy on the outside and to my huge surprised, there was a creme filling inside. It wasn't overly sweet either and definitely the star of the meal for me.fried chicken and waffles - I prefer fried chicken with bones, not really a fan of chicken fingers(?), but I must say it was fried very well. It was crispy and chicken was not dry; overall still pretty solid dish especially with the side gravy.red velvet cupcakes - if you're a fan of red velvet, I would recommend this. Pancakes were delicious and more so on the thin side; I would still consider it fluffy and soft. I would've continued to inhale this dish but I was all carb'd out.bacon lollis - I would prob. pass on this next time. A bit too sweet for my liking and flavor combo didn't appeal to me."
Mary Lou S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7/14/2017,5.0,"We were recently in Washington DC and decided to try Founding Fathers for breakfast. I had made reservations for a later time as we thought we would be done with our tour to the White House letter.  However, we were done earlier and we walked over to the restaurant and they were very gracious and sat us right away.  The service was fantastic, but the food was even better.  The Virgina Smoke Ham  with the Farm fresh eggs was delicious.  I also had a pot of French Pressed Coffee that was really tasty.  My Husband had their thick honey type bacon with eggs and loved it.  Everything is fresh,  even their juices.  It's a good idea to make reservation, even for breakfast as this yummy place fills up quickly!"
Minerva L.,"San Jose, CA",4/21/2017,5.0,"Chicken and waffle was chicken tenders on top of waffles. Maple syrup and waffles were really good. I had the sausage scramble and it was tasty, also had it with the leek hash. Only one kind of hot sauce, if you need jam or the bread, you need to ask. Bread doesn't come buttered, which is nice.Service and speed of food was perfect. Great farm to table brunch place!"
Vibha R.,"Baltimore, MD",9/7/2017,4.0,Place had a phenomenal ambiance! Food was great and cornbread was absolutely glorious! Definitely ask about the beers in tap - they're sure not to disappoint. Most entrees can be made vegetarian! So don't limit yourself to meatless option off the menu!
Sal R.,"Germantown, MD",9/7/2017,5.0,Love this place! Best Chicken and waffles in town! Breakfast is on point! Service is awesome! Trust me head on over to Founding Farmers. You won't regret it!! My word..
Rachel P.,"Miami, FL",4/6/2017,4.0,"Actually went here about a month ago on vacation in DC and definitely cannot complain.  Wait for a table was pretty fast, drinks were good and food was delicious.  Servers and hosts were very friendly.  Chicken and waffles were AMAZING. Restaurant decor was very cute.Planning to stop here again next time I'm in DC - saw a few other things I really want to try."
Becky L.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/14/2016,4.0,"Do not come here without a reservation because you will be waiting even if you have one (but much shorter time). We came for lunch and enjoyed it so much we came back the next day for breakfast. The prosciutto, fig, mascarpone flatbread with balsamic vinegar was flavorful (savory and sweet) and a great starter to share (too much to eat solo unless you make it your meal). I wasn't a fan of it being served on a cutting board because I worry whether the board is cleaned properly. I would have preferred it served on a slate.The yankee pot roast was amazing. Super hearty comfort food with a sophisticated aesthetic plating. The meat was tender and the mash was creamy. Perfectly seasoned.Beignets were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Not sweet or salty on its own so must use sauces. Without the sauces, you'll surely taste the oil. Huge portion and good for sharing. Service was okay. Too busy to refill out cups with water."
Erin F.,"Philadelphia, PA",3/28/2017,5.0,"Absolutely loved this place!We went here around 12:30 on a Monday afternoon. All of the reviews are true when they say to definitely make a reservation! We had an hour wait, but we were able to score bar seats almost immediately after putting our name in. Our bartender was super busy, but he still managed to accommodate us as much as possible. Founding Farmers is inspired by focusing on cooking from scratch and making their dishes with pure ingredients. When designing the restaurant everything was made from refurbished and recycle materials which is totally cool. Also they only serve tap water as well! -- Everything about our meal was great from start to finish! Besides our tap water I asked for a ginger ale. He made a fresh ginger ale w/ lime for me and it was perfectly refreshing. We were told that we had to order the cornbread for a starter. It was truly the best cornbread we have ever had! So fluffy and was filled with actual pieces of corn. We ended up only eating two pieces because it was so filling! -- For entrees I ordered the turkey and gruyere sandwich w/ a side of fries. It was crispy and delicious! My husband ordered the chicken and waffles which he said was 'slammin'. I tried the order of honey scotch carrots he got and they were awesome too! The next time we are in DC we will definitely back. It's just too good not too!"
Tara R.,"Pearland, TX",8/12/2017,5.0,"We started off with the Brie bread appetizer then ordered the Rotisserie Chicken, Chicken and waffles, Pot roast and a cheeseburger!  Everything was delicious!  Fresh ingredients and it showed!"
Allie G.,"Long Beach, CA",7/4/2017,4.0,"You absolutely need a reservation. Unless you get lucky and find a place at the bar. Portions are really big and worth the price! Really fun cocktail list. I recommend starting with the skillet corn bread. Menu is solid, definitely a good place to check out."
Ann K.,"Columbia, MD",11/14/2016,5.0,"The foods are perfectly seasoned and consistent at Potomac and DC locations. It was quite busy even on late Sunday dinner. The food portion is about right, not too big, not too small. We shared our dishes, family style, and the waitress gladly provided us with bigger spare plates. The service was good and went by smoothly. It's my fault not to be able to finish them all."
Faizah S.,"Boston, MA",7/25/2017,4.0,"Extremely filling, and very reasonably priced for the portions they provided. A great brunch spot but the wait is insanely long so try to make a reservation in advance if you plan to go. I would recommend it to anyone just looking for a nice brunch spot that actually cares about where the food is sourced from. It has various other locations across DC and in Virginia but I have only tried this one. The cornbread was good, I thought the waffle was okay but I did enjoy the flatbread with pesto. Would go back to try a whole new set of entrees. The vibe was pretty nice as well and the bar is pretty extensive, as I noticed since I told drink."
Katie L.,"Washington, DC",9/14/2017,3.0,"Good ambiance, but, in my opinion, over-hyped. Food is solid, but the menu is not that exciting. My biggest annoyance is that every time I make a reservation, I still have to wait at least 15 minutes for a table once I get there."
Jasmine T.,"Washington, DC",3/29/2017,5.0,"This is my favorite restaurant in DC. And it is clearly D.C.'s favorite restaurant because it is ALWAYS packed. I mean ALWAYS. Any day of the week, any time,packed.I always get the chicken and waffles,omg, I like crave it now. And if I'm feeling really fat,I get the red velvet cake which is HUGE. I always have leftovers. I've been with my friends who are vegetarians and they said the meatless options are to-die. I've also been with a group and we all got different things and no one was disappointed. Don't kid yourself, make a reservation or else you will be waiting for DAYS. I've been by myself with no reservation but I had to sit at the bar. Getting a seat at the bar at Founding Farmers is the LITERAL hunger games. I mean people are hovering, ruthless, waiting IMPATIENTLY for a seat. Also, bar service can be questionable because they are SO busy. So just save yourself the trouble and always make a reservation. But definitely go.Always."
Adam K.,"Arlington, VA",9/6/2017,1.0,"Food was pretty good.  Service was pretty awful.  While most things arrived on time and the orders were accurate the servers seemed constantly annoyed with every interaction.  Annoyed we didn't know what we wanted the minute we sat down.  Annoyed we asked questions. They even seemed annoyed when we asked for water as they walked by.  It was as if they all had better things to do interact with us.  Servers were extremely pretentious and disrespectful.  It's a shame too, cause this was my birthday dinner and our party of 12 was quick, easy and respectful.  Though the food was decent, probably won't be returning."

Updated review",5.0,"Founding Farmers is long overdue for an update. I come to DC quite often for work, and it's fairly common that I'll be staying near here. Frankly, even if I'm not, if there's time and energy I'll go out of my way to come over here for dinner. The thing that makes Founding Farmers a winner in my book is that they serve vegetables. Good vegetables. I'm not a vegetarian but I like to balance my diet and so many places in DC only offer salads (which at dinner time I'm not usually looking to make my main meal) or fried/creamed/heavily buttered vegetable sides that run in the $6-8 range. Founding Farmers not only offers great vegetarian entrees (the cauliflower steak is AWESOME) but also some really good and fairly healthy veggie sides, and if you get a ""from the range"" entree you can pick two to go with your entree. My standard choices are the glazed cedar plank salmon or the cauliflower steak, with the green beans and carrots. It's consistent, delicious, and reasonably priced for DC. I rarely stray."
Anise D.,"San Diego, CA",8/1/2017,4.0,"Make sure you either come with a reservation or be prepared to wait atleast 1:15 mins. The food was amazing! Location is perfect and walking distance from the White House. Unique place to go for brunch, you won't be disappointed !"
Lisa T.,"Syracuse, NY",4/1/2017,5.0,"I went here for a late lunch. My friend made a reservation and it's recommended because there is always a long wait. For appetizer we had cornbread. My friends got the chicken pot pie, chicken and waffles that came with 2 sides Macaroni and cheese and glazed carrots. I got the glazed salmon on a plank with two sides candied green beans and 7 cheese macaroni and cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious. So fresh and the price wasn't bad either $24 for my salmon meal. The also made good drinks there. The service was also excellent. Our waiter was nice and friendly. I will definitely come back here if I'm ever in town again."
Alyssa B.,"Washington, DC",9/20/2016,4.0,"I've been going to Founding Farmers since I was a freshman in college at GW.  It's a tad bit overrated and has its ups and downs, but all in all, it's a good restaurant.  I went there last week for one of my FF favorites: the fried chicken with waffles, mac and cheese, and a crop list side (I always get green beans).  The chicken had amazing flavor injected into the meat and in the breading itself, which was perfectly crisp without being oily or heavy.  But sadly, the chicken was dry and overcooked.  The mac and cheese was delicious, as always.  The waffles were delightfully light and fluffy.  The green beans were fine, but slightly overcooked and oversalted.  A solid 4 star meal-- good food with some execution problems. The service was good, but a bit rushed, per usual, since they're always so busy.  Not worth the hype, but still worth a visit for sure.  I've been here at least a dozen times in the past 7 years and have always had a fairly good meal.  Their biggest flaw is that they can be inconsistent depending on the day and the dish.  I've definitely had some meals here that were closer to 3 star quality.  Fried chicken is generally a safe bet though.  It's one of their most popular dishes for a reason!"
Alfred C.,"Austin, TX",9/11/2017,1.0,Under cooked outer layer of my NY Steak while the inner is over cooked; sautéed spinach is burnt every other bite. Save your time and go to the one in McLean guys! Nice staff tho
David S.,"Irvine, CA",8/27/2017,4.0,"This was a great restaurant, very crowded but we got in as we had a reservation. All the food that we ordered were hearty and filling. We loved our experience here in next time we are in DC will definitely be there again."
Kacy G.,"Indianapolis, IN",7/3/2017,5.0,"I knew I would like FF when I read the restaurant description and their commitment to supporting local farms and using the best ingredients possible.  We were waiting outside on the street before they opened, and probably 40 people had congregated by the time the doors opened!  Fortunately, we were seated right away.  I had an ordering panic moment.  My friend ordered the hangover hash which I planned on getting.  I have a pretty strict rule about never ordering the same thing as my dining partner---I want to try more things!  So, I made a last minute decision and got the traditional eggs Benedict.  I had a hint of orderers remorse initially, but that was wasted worry as it was so well executed.  Nothing like a well done classic!  My friend's hangover was great as well.  Our server, Hayli, was so kind and very helpful with info about the city.  Overall great experience."
Catherine S.,"Honolulu, HI",9/1/2017,3.0,"This place is a little overrated. I waited 1.5 hours only to find out they forgot to put our names down. Thank goodness one of the host remembered my face and gave us the next available table.  Waffle chicken was alright, have had better ones. The beignets were definitely my favorite on the menu!!!"
Thy N.,"Norfolk, VA",8/8/2017,5.0,"My husband and I went to brunch here, and it was FABULOUS.  Be prepared to wait though.  He and I arrived around 10:00 am, and it was an hour wait for a table for 2.  I'd recommend making reservations in advance. We found two open seats at the bar almost immediately though, so that may be an option for you. The bar service was great.  She was very attentive, but not overbearing.  Water, drinks, and coffee were refilled quickly.  It was a bit cramped at the bar, but only because the plates/portions were fairly hearty.  I got the crab benedict, and he got the chicken and waffles.  Both were cooked and prepared perfectly.  We also got a plate of the beignets, and they were divine.  There were six very large beignets with three different dipping sauces - raspberry, caramel, and chocolate. I've been here several times for breakfast and dinner, and I have never been disappointed."
Troy S.,"San Diego, CA",6/21/2017,5.0,"Loved this place!   Great food, great service, and a great story.  The food is farm to table and everything was delicious!  Chicken and waffles...wow!  I also had the Shrimp & Grits with Andouille...simply perfect.   I'm going to have to book another trip back east to enjoy some of their other dishes.  Their story is cool too...owned by the North Dakota Farmer's Union (about 47,000 members) who wanted to take people back to the source, to the foods that are grown, raised, and harvested on American family farms.  This is American allegiance and no better place to represent than in DC.  I just happen to be from ND too...they made me proud!"
Melissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",6/23/2017,4.0,I went here years ago but never got around to doing a review. This place is a thing and I highly recommend a reservation even if say you're doing an early breakfast mid-week - still make a res. I had some type of stuffed pancake/waffle thing with red velvet where I don't remember details but do remember it being delicious. Check out this place and come here to celebrate America through food.
Ashley A.,"Las Vegas, NV",4/30/2017,5.0,Yes the hype was worth it and yes you should go. If you want to do brunch make sure you have made a reservation a couple of days in advance. My only gripes are that the hostesses were kinda snotty and they ran out of the Brie flat bread. I think founding farmers needs to hire a couple more people to wrangle all the people
Linda F.,"Worcester, MA",4/10/2017,4.0,"This was our first visit to this restaurant and I can honestly say that everything about eating at Founding Farmer's is great. Our server was prompt and attentive, and the food was spectacular. We started with sharing the Devil-ish Eggs: Classic. There is a seafood combo version as well but we weren't in the mood for it. The eggs were as described - the classic deviled eggs taste and texture. I ordered the Yankee pot roast and my husband got the Fish of the Day rock fish cooked à la meunière, which is butter, shallots, garlic, and lemon. Both dishes were flavorful and cooked perfectly. We finished off our meal with a slice of carrot cake and a slice of chocolate mousse cake, both served with vanilla bean ice cream. The portions met or exceeded my expectation. Be warned that the desserts are very big and can be shared with another person. We ended up taking home half a slice of each cake + I had some leftover pot roast and mashed potatoes. The only thing that deducts from FF being a 5-star experience is the lack of a comfortable waiting area. We had a 5pm Saturday reservation and the place was already packed to the walls in the small waiting area with people waiting out in the street. It wasn't the best introduction to restaurant, but the rest of the experience makes up for it."
Hugh M.,"Halifax, Canada",3/19/2017,5.0,"Sometimes I only come to DC for a meal here. This time is one of those. I'm on my way to Atlanta, and pulled in to get brunch. This place is the single busiest place to eat brunch on or near the national mall. Do yourself a favour, eat here, but get a reservation. The best brunch food EVER!"
Meleah S.,"Charlotte, NC",9/15/2016,5.0,"Oh. My. Goodness. I have so many great things to say. We ate here on a recent trip to DC and both agree that we will make it a permanent stop every time we visit. We made a reservation and still had to wait 20 min for a table (although those without a reservation had an hour and a half wait). We ordered drinks (which were great), a flatbread appetizer (also good but we both agreed that the meals were so filling that we would skip the flatbread next time), chicken and waffles for him (he absolutely loved it), and chicken bolognese for me (I cleaned my plate). We had no room for dessert because we were so full. Prices were okay. Not cheap but not super crazy expensive. Service was good. No one was rude but no one was super friendly (at least by my raised-in-the-south friendliness standards). Definitely recommend this place!"
Victor L.,"Virginia Square, Arlington, VA",8/6/2017,5.0,"Didn't notice how popular this place was before coming in for lunch today. Wait was over an hour (party of 4) even though Google Maps indicated ""less busy than usual"" for a Sunday afternoon. Food was well worth the wait."
Olga S.,"Clayton, NC",7/4/2017,4.0,"This place seem to be the only one that now matters for brunch in the neighborhood. Especially on Sunday. The wait was literally up to two hours and waiting room was as overcrowded as public transportation in Russia during Soviet era. I had gotten from being hungry to fatigued and ""hangry"". People stopped exchanging pleasantries and were avoiding eye contact. America stopped being America. Over waffles and eggs, people. One question? Was it worth the wait? Well you decide. Food was fine. The eggs from pasture raised chickens tasted just as delicious as ones from the caged ones. Chicken sausage was juicy and ciabatta toast charred and delightful. I also was able to taste a waffle and one huge blueberry pancake from my son's plate. I tasted this before. It was just good. Not more than that. Restrooms need baby changing table. Service was good. In general nothing to write home about. Next time I ask going to the empty hotel restaurant across the street. I ll just ask them not to tell me how they raised their chickens."
Chelsea A.,"Cincinnati, OH",10/16/2016,5.0,"YASSSS!!! This spot is a DC fav for obvious reasons (i.e. their relationship with local farmers & their delicious food). When my birthday rolled around, there was no question about where I wanted to go. After a frustrating trip on the metro, I was sooooo ready for a cocktail. I decided to be a bit adventurous and go with a custom cocktail from the bartender. I was presented with a delicious gin drink with almond liquor and citrus called ""The Elizabeth."" The only downside was the price. At $15, I think I'll stick to a glass of wine in the future. We also ordered the bbq nuts for snacking. They were mixed with golden currants for a bit of sweetness. Yum!For dinner, I really couldn't decide what to order because the menu is so large and everything sounded great! Fortunately we had THE best waiter ever, Jason (I think). He was fantastic and went over everything on the menu with us. When I say ""the best"", I mean I want to be his friend so we can go on culinary adventures together and he can curate all our meals. The way he described the dishes made my mouth water! I ended up ordering the plank salmon, which was superb! I wish I was a bit more adventurous with my sides, but was mostly satisfied with the mashed potatoes and green beans. For dessert (it was my birthday, of course I had to get dessert!) I ordered the red velvet cake with strawberry ice cream. It came complete with a birthday candle :)"
Stefanie C.,"San Francisco, CA",9/4/2016,4.0,"Apparently, this is a popular place to eat in DC. It came highly recommended by many friends, even one who lives in DC, so I decided to meet up with her here. She made reservations, which is a must for Founding Farmers.We were seated when our whole party arrived, and I still chuckle (yes, I said chuckle) at the brand new waiter that we got. A friend who I was traveling with was essentially interrogating the waiter about why there were two menus with so much overlap, and the waiter eventually caved in and apologized for being new there. Poor guy!As for the food, I started with a Bloody Mary, which was tasty! Sufficiently spicy to my liking. We also started with Uncle Buck's Beignets. They were giant and came with a few different dipping sauces. These weren't particularly unique but still good.For my entrée, I ordered the Beef Pastrami Hash. Delicious! Loved the fresh ingredients and mix of flavors. Mine came on an English muffin with a poached egg. Would definitely recommend this. My friend got the Fresh Strawberries & Cream Stuffed French Toast. I wasn't too impressed by this, but maybe Founding Farmers just isn't known for their French Toast.Overall I had a great experience here! I wouldn't say it's a MUST in DC, but you won't regret coming here, especially if you're a fan of restaurants with locally-made and fresh ingredients."
June J.,"Hampton, VA",9/4/2017,5.0,"Food was great! Went for brunch and had beignets, grits, and bacon. Grits were amazing! No kids menu but lots of options for little ones. Only drawback is that drinks are pricey. And no refills on an Arnold Palmer? Overall, I would eat here again."
Vanessa H.,"Falls Church, VA",7/13/2017,5.0,"Came to this exact location twice in the past year, once for mid-day lunch and the other for a late night dinner. Sitting on the first floor is great, but I found the top floor to be much better and more intimate due to the bar chatter you can hear across the way. The food was elegant and presented well. I had the salmon, and the appetizer was an ample portion too. I look forward to trying out the Tysons Corner location to see how it compares with this one."
Sam K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",9/2/2016,5.0,"YES! By far the best stop of my trip. 8,300+ mostly good reviews is nothing to trifle with. This farm to table concept restaurant has the best quality/dollar-sign ratio ever. Who can argue with farm fresh ingredients for a price not much higher than a night out at Chile's?We were seated upstairs with a table near the window looking out onto the city street. The decor is really welcoming and stylish. It reminded me of S3 in Fort Lauderdale for those who are familiar with South Florida. (Sorry if that reference doesn't help you, but you have thousands of other reviews to look at.)If I had one piece of advice, do not leave without trying the cornbread! It was the best home-made style cornbread that I have had. It is filled with corn kernels and the contains the perfect texture paired with a savory and mildly sweet flavor.I am always tempted to get some kind of beef related entree when at this type of restaurant. I ordered the rib-eye, which was surprisingly well priced, with a side of salted mint watermelon and pearl pasta. Of course, I had my steak medium rare. When they brought it out, it was definitely more on the rare side, but I was feeling adventurous so I didn't mind. It was one of the best steaks that I have had. I have had a LOT of steaks... Seasoned minimally and perfectly. The watermelon really complimented the steak in a way that is difficult to describe. The pearl pasta had it's own unique blend of flavors and ingredients that was truly mouth watering.For dessert, a simple scoop of vanilla ice cream. It doesn't hurt that they make it in house from scratch! However, I don't have much to say about this dish other than that it was very good. Service was good. Our waiter could have been slightly more attentive, but it was extremely busy, so I understand why he may not have been.  Also, I am not sure why they partnered with farms in the Midwest instead of more responsibly sourced local farms. I am sure that they have a good reason. But, sourcing from so far away is a part of the problem that this concept of restaurant is advertising that it is not contributing to."
Alex C.,"Miami, FL",8/5/2017,4.0,Great food and great service at hipster restaurant near Georgetown. The service earned 5 stars. Although there were a dozen plus people waiting they honored our reservation within 5 minutes of our arrival. Our server Marc was super friendly and offered up some excellent recommendations from the menu which we tried. The crab and corn dip was as Delicious as it was unique. Served with jalapeño garnish and crusty bread it was a hit at our table for 4. We enjoyed the Arctic char Menuiere and the short rib. The food was served in a timely manner and piping hot. We will return.
Shana R.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",8/28/2017,5.0,This was our first trip here! This restaurant is farm to table. We started with a pesto flatbread which was delicious- the bread was so fresh as well as other ingredients. We had the wings which my children enjoyed! I had the cedar plank salmon which was fresh and yummy! My husband and fried chicken with waffles and came with a side of Mac and cheese. The portions were generous and reasonably priced. For desert we had yummy cookies and ice cream. Highly recommend this restaurant. Family friendly! Amazing food!
Riley B.,"Lehi, UT",6/30/2017,5.0,We were visiting family in DC and this was recommended by so many people for a great reason. Everything we had was incredibly delicious. We wish we could have ordered more. The cheese and meat plate was our favorite.
Geena F.,"Nashville, TN",6/30/2017,3.0,"First time I went here it was awesome! Food was yummy and the people were amazing!  This time when I went the food was just ok.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good meal, but not one that blew me away.  The people were still incredibly nice though!  It's definitely a place you must go to if it's your first time in DC."
Talisha R.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",10/25/2016,4.0,"I've been to Founding Farmers on many occasions and I'm surprised that I'm just now getting around to leaving a review. The food is pretty good and will leave you satisfied I've had many dishes her from the chickens and waffles to chicken salad sandwich,  everything has been really good. I would say that for large groups that the service goes down one notch. I've been two times with my coworkers and it was numerous times on both occasions that we had to send food back or request the food to be reheated.I will continue to go but I may check out another location but this one is close to my job so it very convenient for lunch."
Jared H.,"Takoma Park, MD",8/28/2017,4.0,"The food is good - especially for breakfast. A good place to bring parents or donors or business clients for a relaxed meal that still has a wow factor but with stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. 'Nuvelle Country Comfort' or ""a super fancy cracker barrell"" Save room for fresh donuts!"
Jeanne T.,"Yardley, PA",8/24/2017,5.0,Visited on a weekday morning in late August. Service was quick and great. We ordered one whipped blueberry pancake and the crab meat eggs Benedict. Both were really delicious and highly recommend!
Vicki N.,"Duluth, GA",3/13/2017,4.0,"I've heard rave reviews about this restaurant, so we definitely had to make a reservation to try it out. Our reservation was at 6:30pm on a Saturday night. When we walked in, it was extremely packed. People were everywhere. They were running slightly behind, so we weren't seated until maybe 6:40-6:45pm.Our table shared multiple dishes:1. Skillet Cornbread- This cornbread was moist and sweet with bits of corn in it. I love sweet cornbread. It also comes with a side of butter+honey mixed together. Definitely slather that onto it.2. Brie Farm Bread- This particular Farm Bread comes topped with brie, green apple and onion jam. I was a huge fan of this. I love sweet and savory combinations.3. Boneless Ribeye- We ordered this and requested their Mexican corn as a side along with the Maple Bacon Brussel Sprouts. The sides were amazing!! I'm a huge fan of Mexican corn. It comes topped with mayo, cotjia cheese and paprika. So good! The Ribeye, however, was not as good as I thought it would be. The quality of the meat was not that great considering it's a nicer restaurant. Also, the meat was seasoned with something odd, not just salt and pepper. I couldn't exactly figure out what it tasted like, but I was not a fan of it. We asked for medium rare, but we ended up receiving medium-medium well. I would not order the Ribeye again.Btw- The Mexican corn was not on the menu as a side. The waiter stated that the corn comes with specific dishes, but we requested it as a replacement side, and the waiter was able to accommodate.Our waiter was nice and attentive. Someone in my group wasn't happy with the taste of her drink, and he was happy to switch it out for us.  Also, if you're looking for a nonalcoholic beverage, definitely try their lemonade. It's freshly sqeezed and tastes great!"
Hazel C.,"San Leandro, CA",8/29/2016,4.0,"My sister made a reservation for 6 people for dinner here and though DC was my second home for a long time, this was only my first time here. Popular place! Make sure you have a reservation or you could be waiting a while! My sister, her fiancé and I had been craft brewery hopping all day, and snacking, so unfortunately I was not that hungry. Do come hungry as they serve you big portions here. I ended up taking most of my dinner home as the appetizers made me full real fast. For the table to share, we ordered the Skillet Corn Bread, Deviled Eggs and their Farm Bread with Brie, Onion Jam and Apple. I loved the Corn Bread the best. It was cakey, moist and yummy with the sea salt, honey and butter on top. Definitely a must get if you're dining here. Nothing particularly memorable about their Deviled Eggs and the Brie on Bread, but they were devoured by the group! I ordered the Chicken and Waffle dish which also came with Mac and Cheese. I chose the Mint Watermelon for my side. It was a lot of food! I tasted a bit of each item on my plate, but I took most of it home. The chicken was crunchy, not greasy and was moist and tasty. My sister ordered Spaghetti and she really liked hers too. My sister's fiancé's stepmom ordered the smaller cut of the Prime Rib and it was huge. The cut she was given had a lot of fat on it! Geez! Everyone loved their cocktails! The Cucumber Delight cocktail was very popular amongst our group. They ordered a couple of rounds of those. I had one of their Scratch Sodas, the Ginger one, and it was perfect. For dessert, we ordered just one thing, the Seasonal Fruit Crisp. Most of us were quite full at this point. That one desert was big enough though for 4 people. Founding Farmers is run by the North Dakota Farmers Union, so a majority of what's used in the restaurant comes from the 40,000 farmers that make up the Union. FF is one of DC's first Farm to Table restaurants. Next time you're in DC, check it out. And check out the water feature next door at the International Monetary Fund on your way to your car."
Lauren H.,"Mt Olive, NC",8/4/2017,5.0,We ate here back in march. We had to wait a super long time to get a table and we had to sit outside in the snow because the waiting area is so small but it was worth it. The waiter we had was so sweet and knew all about the menu. My husband loved his chicken and waffles. I got the meatloaf. It wasn't the best meatloaf I have ever eaten but the carrots were amazing. That was my favorite part of the meal. We would return!
Gretchen R.,"Needham, IN",3/15/2017,5.0,"Can I just put in a mattress and live here? Aesthetically pleasing, fun environment, and the biggest best menu. Holy cow. I want to book flights to DC just so I can eat more off the menu. Our waiter was so fun and was helpful in making suggestions. From appetizers, to drinks, to main course- this place is the bomb. Plus did I mention they have WARM COOKIES as a dessert option? #winning"
Koko A.,"Washington, DC",8/30/2017,5.0,"I love this place. Food tasted very good. Service was great also. There is a good selection. The wait was frustrating, however."

Updated review",3.0,Still a 3 star experience for me and reconfirmed what I said a year ago. We had a 11 am brunch reservation and still had to wait a while when we came on time. Our friend picked Founding Farmers since it's within walking distance to the White House. They really score on their location since we walked by around 3 pm from our White House Tour and there's still people waiting to be seated. Food - I had the ranch steak and eggs and the steak was overcooked from what I requested. The best brunch item from our group was the crab benedict. The fresh crab meat to egg ratio was proportional and seasoned well. I do wish that their menu will state the difference between their chicken and waffle from breakfast and dinner. The sides are included in the menu description but the part of the chicken varies greatly. The breakfast chicken and waffle have fried chicken strips/tenders vs. the dinner version is a fried chicken leg and thigh.
Helen H.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/19/2016,5.0,"Came as a tourist to D.C. - a quick yelp research showed that Founding Farmers was easily one of the top rated restaurants in the area. A little apprehensive of the long wait described in other reviews, we decided to go in to try our luck for an early dinner on a Saturday. After exploring the area around National Mall, we walked over to the restaurant around 5pm and was able to get a table for 2 in half an hour with the caveat that a party with reservations for the table would be arriving around 6:30pm. Fair enough.We started off with glazed bacon lollies ($10) - about 10 skewers on the plate, a nice mix of savory and sweet. Kinda reminds me of jerky.I got the Shrimp and Sundried Tomato Bucatini ($19) - this was so delicious .. you could really taste the freshness of each ingredients from the pasta to the sundried tomatoes to the plump juicy shrimp. One of those dishes where you can really believe that everything is handmade to order with the best ingredients. Sauce got a bit salty toward the end but I literally cleared the plate.The boyfriend got one of their signatures, Yankee Potroast ($16) which I was able to snag some bites of. The meat was tender and the greens tasted crisp and fresh. The mashed potatoes was creamy with the gravy. Hearty, fulfilling meal. We really didn't leave much room for dessert but I wanted to try their beignets based on all the reviews. The waiter warned us it could take up to half an hour to make but there was a batch more readily available. It came with chocolate, caramel, and a raspberry coulis sauce. It was pretty good and more than enough for two, but some of them were already cold by the time it got to us. I probably wouldn't order it again.Overall, the service was nice and the entrees were super delicious so while the dessert didn't quite meet the rest of the meals standards, it was all in all a great experience. 4.5 stars."
Alejandra B.,"Miami, FL",10/18/2016,4.0,"I came here for dinner during my short trip to DC as it was highly recommended because of their cornbread.We ended up getting the rib eye steak. For my own taste, it had way too much fat. The potatoes were really delicious. I highly regret not getting the cornbread. I will definitely be coming back here. The service was great, the drinks were good too, and most importantly, I really enjoyed the restaurant's vibe. Lastly, get the donuts!!!"
Omar S.,"Washington, DC",10/18/2016,3.0,"Having been here a few times (ok, I've been here quite a bit actually), I've been able to identify the pros and cons of FF.FF's strongest point is their brunch. By far one of the better places in the District, particularly in the areas near downtown and around the White House. This means that you can expect a solid wait time, sometimes 2 hours or more, so it helps to have a reservation, which can be done over the phone or online. Weekends are very busy during brunch, so keep that in mind if you're expecting to show up and find a table right away. Service isn't 'slow', it's understandably busy, so be kind to your waiter/waitress.For the food:Almost every single time I show up at FF for brunch I order the stuffed french toast. This is the one (and only) item I suggest ordering. It's heavenly and deliciously good. That is my go to and has been for the last 5 years, particularly the bananas foster. Creamy, but not overly sweet. This is a must, especially if you're visiting for the first time. You will not go wrong with this selection.Some savory options to consider: the chicken and waffles and the steak and eggs.Aside from those options nothing else really stands out. On a recent visit I ordered the pancakes, but I was disappointed as I felt they were underwhelming, somewhat dense and weren't up to par with what I envision pancakes to be (fluffy & moist).I've also had lunch and dinner at FF, but not really feeling it. To me it just doesn't elicit the same excitement as brunch and the food is just ok.$4 for a cup of coffee... I just don't understand the logic behind that"
Heathet B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",8/2/2017,4.0,Visited the restaurant based on good reviews. I came in by myself and sat at the bar around 5:45 on a Wednesday evening.Pros: -had a very nice female bartender-the pesto bread was DELICIOUS!! Cons:-the restaurant was so busy and the entrance was very crowded-which in turn made it very loud. This is not a spot to enjoy a quiet decent meal by yourselfSo-So:-the mushroom risotto was okay. I would eat it but not recommend it.The menu had many options along with a great cocktail list.
Erica L.,"Columbia Heights, Washington, DC",6/15/2017,2.0,"The most overrated four-star place in DC on Yelp.  Ever.  I've been here many, many times over the years, starting back in the day when DC was just filled with indistinguishable steakhouses.  At the time, this was a refreshing change, but even back then, and continuing to now, it's hit or miss.  Sometimes the food is good.  Sometimes the food is just awful (think half-raw cornbread in a skillet, or a veggie meatloaf with a sticky gravy that gives you a gag reflex and scary flashbacks to awful 80s nutritional eating).  Sometimes you can't get a clean plate or clean silverware.  And the service is always atrocious and inconsiderate.  Wait a while for a table even if you have a reservation, then be prepared to sit asscheek to asscheek, even if you're there dressed in a suit, clearly on a work lunch, at a table much too small, then wait 30 minutes to have a waiter come back to take your order, acting as though it's beneath them to speak with you.  I don't understand why this place is busy when the DC food scene has picked up and within a five block radius there are a handful of much better restaurants, no matter whether you're looking for something casual or upscale.  I assume the tourists and out of towners like it.  But I most definitely do not.  And I'll do anything I can now to prevent my office from having lunches here.  Because it's that embarrassingly bad."
R J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/7/2017,1.0,I seriously do not understand why there is an hour wait to get into this place. It is basic assembly line breakfast food. They're trying to get people in & out so fast that once I sat down I felt rushed to get out. Bloody Mary was decent. Very spicy which I like [and server was informative enough to tell me it would be]. But there wasn't much in it to balance out the spice so it too was underwhelming.Recommendation: Don't wait. Find someplace else to brunch it up!
Casey W.,"Manhattan, NY",5/1/2017,4.0,"I make it a point to come here every time I'm in DC. It's not hard to see why it's wildly popular: great quality food, a HUGE menu with dishes more creative than most places of the same genre, and helpful, friendly staff. That being said, the service is sometimes unpredictable: I had to make a train back to New York City, and got anxious about timing because my party of 2 waited over 40 mins for our food. However, my slight irritation at the wait was pretty much quelled when my black pepper maple bacon arrived. Don't miss this place if you're visiting D.C. A favorite of tourists and locals alike."
Randolph Z.,"Orlando, FL",2/24/2017,3.0,"Hype is justified. FF offers some very thoughtful courses in American food with a bourgie twist. Think ""slab of bread with Brie and an impossibly complex jelly.""We did end up waiting for two hours despite making a reservation by phone A MONTH AHEAD OF TIME. They had no record of our reservation and despite showing that the call was made to the correct location, we waited."
Mike K.,"Montgomery, NJ",8/16/2017,5.0,"I went slightly out of my way to dine here on a recent trip to D.C. and I'm glad I did. Outstanding meal and great ambiance! The food is clearly expertly made with the freshest ingredients. I ordered a ginger ale, which was homemade and the best I've ever tasted. For my main course I had the chicken and waffles. The waffles were so light and fluffy that I could've fit an entire one in my mouth whole. The chicken was perfectly friend and it came with a delicious pasta side plus sautéed green beans. I wish I had had time for dessert, they looked excellent!"
Hannjoo M.,"Arlington, VA",10/14/2016,4.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this place because the reviews (both on yelp and from friends) are pretty mixed. I thought it was worth giving it a try so I came here with a friend visiting from Illinois. I didn't realize just how popular it was, I know I know I should've done my research, so I didn't make reservations and we had to wait an hour and a half. It worked out ok though because this place is right around the corner from the White House so my friend and I walked around and did some tourist-y sight seeing and we went back in time for our table. Interior design: I LOVED the inside of the restaurant, there's an elegant yet DIY feeling to it. I kind of what my future dining room to look like the inside of Founding Farmers. What I didn't like though, was how crowded the seating was. I felt like I was in France, where all the tables are practically on top of each other. My friend and I were seated at a long table with a bunch of other people, so it seemed like we were all eating together even though we were separate groups. But with it being such a popular restaurant and limited seating available, we'll take what we can get. Food: We ordered the devilish eggs and the farmhouse platter. I know they're simple, but the devilish eggs were SO good. Like if I ever come here again, I will order this appetizer again and I rarely order the same thing when I go to a restaurant repeatedly. The farmhouse platter was also delicious. All of the meat was tender, it was easy to share, and all of the food was enough to decently satisfy the two of us. This is the same friend that went to Nashville with me and we both agreed that the farmhouse platter wasn't nearly as good as the TX platter at Butchertown Hall in Nashville...but it was good enough. Overall, this is a nice place to come to for a special occasion, but it's pretty expensive and I won't be coming here on the regular.Side note pretty sure I lost my glasses here. T-T"
Gellie E.,"Washington, DC",8/25/2016,3.0,"I came here for a birthday celebration and my experience was completely average. If you're looking for some birthday recognition or want to feel special, this ain't the place.We were able to get a reservation on their website for the weekend brunch seating. I made the reservation on Thursday morning for a Sunday lunch and most of the good times were already filled - the only times remaining were after 2:30pm. If you don't have any luck getting an online reservation timeslot, try giving them a call - the timeslots on the phone were slightly different than the ones online.Based on the other Yelp reviews, we got there 30 minutes early because we didn't want to have to wait 20-40 additional minutes after our reservation time. Getting there earlier doesn't get you seated earlier - they told us we would be seated at our reservation time. Fair enough. We waited in the corner and they have books about sustainability that you can browse in the meantime. There's guest WiFi, but the guest password was kept under wraps, so I don't think that counts. We were seated pretty closely to our reservation time.We were seated on the ground floor, and it was loud. Our waitress was soft-spoken and half the table couldn't hear what she was saying. I thought she was going to come to the other side of the table to repeat her spiel, but nope. Whatever intro/greeting she gave remains a mystery to me.I ordered the scallops meuniere with butternut risotto. The dish comes with a scoop of risotto in the middle and five diver scallops and a lemon surrounding it. The scallops were nicely cooked, but I prefer more of a sear. The dish in general was on the bland side - nothing wowed me with flavor - and I'm glad the dish came with a lemon because it needed it. The dish also needed some texture.Just like the meal, service was nothing special either. Service was neither neglectful nor exceptional. Everyone got a small water cup and vase for the table for self-service, though the vase didn't have ice in it so refills became more and more lukewarm as the afternoon went on. I was the first to finish my dish by a mile and it was the last plate to be cleared (also by a mile).Farm-to-table is cool and sustainability is cool - I can support that. I would come here again, but I wouldn't order the scallop dish again... maybe brunch."
Pari P.,"Schaumburg, IL",8/28/2016,4.0,"Sustainable slow food from farm to table. That's the premise at Founding Farmers where their ingredients come from farmers across the US. The term might be slow food but expect a long wait without reservations and even a time that you need to finish your meal since this place is popular. We had reservations for 6pm and were asked to finish our meal by 8:15pm for a party of 10. The menu is a range of dishes from classic American fare to pastas and salads. The food itself didn't taste significantly different but it was good to know where it was coming from. I appreciate that the food portions were larger than I was expecting and the prices were completely reasonable. Ironically, the reason why it doesn't cost an arm and leg is because not everything is locally sourced. The website is transparent and states that they avoid buying from the corporate chain as much as possible but sometimes that doesn't always happen. Either way, Founding Farmers still provides awesome sustainable food while supporting our nation's farmers. They are showing that sustainable food is important while still being affordable and delicious."
Ross J.,"Hermitage, TN",3/22/2017,4.0,"On a trip to Washington DC, we were excited to get into Founding Farmers because it was so highly recommended. Our experience was good but not great.It started with a really small waiting area that was overpacked. That was a feeling somewhere between sardines and The Who concert. The hostess was not really rude but just not friendly when we checked in 10 minutes before our 7:45 reservation.Got a great table upstairs which was not near as loud as downstairs. Our server was great.We ordered kettle corn as an appetizer, goat cheese ravioli, chicken and waffles with mac and cheese and brussel sprouts, chicken tenders and fries, and the chicken pot pie. Nothing was bad but the only things that were really delicious were the brussel sprouts and the chicken tenders and fries.Of the 5 sit down restaurants we went to in Washington DC on this trip, all of them were good but the other four were better than Founding Farmers."
Alison B.,"Washington, DC",6/25/2017,5.0,My first experience at one of the Founding Farmers restaurants and it was amazing. I got the butternut squash goat cheese ravioli and it was terrific. They have great appetizers too! Good place to take family.
Linnea T.,"Seattle, WA",3/4/2017,5.0,"This place was insanely busy on a Tuesday...a TUESDAY! So make reservations if you hope to be seated in less than 1 hour. It's no wonder this spot is popular with its beautifully varied farm-to-table menu. It was difficult to decide but I eventually settled with the fish of the day, cooked in the simple style. We shared the brie bread as an appetizer and a gigantic piece of apple pie for dessert. Everything everyone order was excellent and largely portioned (including the salads); you will not walk away hungry! My only gripe is because they're so busy, the table service and food turnaround can be a little slow. The staff are definitely the sweetest, though, and very devoted to their jobs and patrons. As long as you're not in a rush, the food will more than make up for the crazy crowds, but do come with plenty of time and maybe earplugs if you don't like loud restaurants."
Andrew D.,"Boston, MA",2/27/2017,3.0,"Following my visit to the White House, I was close to Founding Farmers and decided to stop in for lunch. A quick online search revealed this to be a popular spot with a ""farm fresh"" take on things. We didn't make reservations and were lucky to find two open seats at the bar-- otherwise it would have been a 15 minute wait for a lunchtime table. We started with the Prosciutto Farm Bread- three slices of focaccia bread topped with mascarpone, balsamic, fig, prosciutto. We loved this- although I found the fig to make the bread very sweet overall. We then ordered the Blue Cheese Balsamic Bacon Burger and the Avocado Bacon Burger. Both were cooked perfectly (medium-rare, as requested- if not almost rare). The burgers were delicious, but they are heavy, and we tired from them early-on. Both burgers also came with fries. We also drank local beers-- they offer a smaller, 8oz pour, which was perfect for lunchtime. The bartender, Ryan, was a little abrasive, but decent overall. We watched as he crafted some fun looking cocktails- worth checking out next time. What we found unappetizing and unsanitary was the bartender, Ryan, counting his tips (coins and bills) on the bar cutting board. He laid out the money on the cutting board where he had been cutting lemons, limes, etc. He also never washed his hands and proceeded to continue prepping cocktails amongst other things. If someone has an upset stomach following lunch here, the dirty cutting board at the bar could be a possible culprit. Overall, we enjoyed our lunch at Founding Farmers- the food was tasty, and the price was reasonable. We will return in the future."
Sophia L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",7/21/2017,4.0,"stopped here for a late lunch. we made reservations for 1:45 pm. pro-tip: make a reservation so you don't have to wait forever! the waiting area is cramped! my sister and i ordered the chicken and waffles ($16), which comes with macaroni and cheese and green beans. my dad ordered the pot roast ($16). oh wait before that we ordered skillet cornbread as an appetizer ($5). i think it's funny that cornbread is what stole the show, but if i could eat that cornbread for my every meal, i would. definitely order that if you have the chance. the chicken was juicy and well-seasoned. the green beans and mac & cheese were aight. the waffles were pretty good, very light and fluffy! this place is really nice!! service was good and quick. the food was excellent. prices were on the high end of reasonable, if that makes any sense?? ambience is a lil fancy for a restaurant that has chili cheeseburgers on the menu but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i would definitely stop by (after making a reservation!) if planning on being in the area. REMEMBER TO ORDER THE CORNBREAD."
Kaley R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/29/2017,4.0,"This restaurant is a foodie's heaven. Every single aspect of this place was so beautifully thought out, all with farm to table in mind.The atmosphere is outstanding. Food is superb (I've never even used that word to describe food before). I'm only not giving this place five stars because service could have been a bit better (but it was packed so I can understand how busy things were) and because I still have to come back and give their cocktails a try - which are a huge point of pride for this place.I went here with my boyfriend for my birthday dinner on Saturday. He made a reservation for 4:45, but we still had to wait 15/20 minutes or so because of how busy it was. Once we were seated upstairs, our waitress came by to give us a rundown of the cocktail menu and apps to start (with a few of her recommendations as well), and we went with the spicy crab and corn dip. So freaking amazing. Omg. I thought the bread would be hard and crunchy by the look of it, but it only had a light crisp that made it slightly crunchy and it was perfect. Then paired with that crab dip... the flavors are AMAZING. Just the right amount of spice. For my entree I had the slow braised beef short rib with the 7 cheese mac n cheese (GET IT) and maple roasted Brussels sprouts. Both sides were out of this world (only using that phrase to get the point across). The short rib was good - meat was cooked perfectly, but I could've done with less sauce. My boyfriend had the avocado bacon burger with the kettle chips and both were wonderful (I also tried them, of course).I'm seriously already trying to figure out when I can go back. I want to try about 80 more things on the menu so... stay tuned Yelpers."
Christina J.,"Holmdel Township, NJ",7/2/2017,5.0,LOVED the food here!! I was so happy when I saw the designated vegetarian friendly section. I had the rice/bean and tofu sandwich and opted for the green beans side. Amazing! It was absolutely perfect. Good portions and amazing flavors!
TennisBum P.,"Aptos, CA",6/29/2017,4.0,"I had read reviews that raved about FF, and I read that it was the #1 ""over-hyped"" restaurant.  I wouldn't worry about the over-hype.  Everything I had was enjoyable.  Having reservations is smart.What I found was very good ""comfort food"".  I enjoyed the meal so much that late one night without reservations, I went back to give it a second try.  Everything I had was very well done so you're probably safe ordering what you feel like.  The only complaint I have would be that the draft beer was not cold (it was like I was in England before Thatcher)."
Nick M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/28/2017,3.0,"I don't get it. Many of the reviews of Founding Farmers make it seem like Jesus himself dines here. Add that to the absolutely massive crowd in front on a Sunday morning, and you have a hype machine that makes it seem like this is one of the best restaurants on the eastern seaboard. Seriously, it looked like there was at least an HOUR wait when we walked in. We, fortunately, had reservations, but if I didn't, this spot would have gotten two stars. Lend me your ear and I'll elaborate on the rest.Founding Farmers finds it's strength in the details. Namely, all their food is locally sourced from organic, sustainable farms, they have a prohibition era style bar where they make most of the ingredients and mix-ins from scratch, and they have an interesting sounding menu with items like Red Velvet pancakes. I won't say anything was bad we had. I had a breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, and hash browns. We also split the Red Velvet pancakes, which were interesting, but didn't really taste that much different from pancakes make with vanilla extract in the mix. Though, they were red. The bacon was actually kinda small and overcooked. The eggs were just ok. The hash browns were tasty, though. Overall, everything we had was either disappointing or just ok. Even my cocktail, their take on a Gin Fizz, was interesting, with a nice egg-white foam on top, but taste wise, it wasn't anything fancy.Our waiter was awesome, though. Super attentive, friendly and helpful. And luckily we got a table upstairs as the noise level downstairs where the majority of the people waiting, was absolutely deafening. Overhyped, under delivering is all that comes to mind when I think of Founding Farmers. If you are looking for an amazing brunch, look elsewhere. If their pulls are your thing, then visit for lunch. But for the love of god, get a reservation first!"
Mike M.,"Blue Bell, PA",3/2/2017,4.0,"Founding Farmers is always packed.  On each of a few trips I've had a wait for seating, even if I wanted to sit at the bar.  It has some of the better cocktails in the area, the service at the bar is fantastic, and the bar area's vibe is pretty nice.  It's lively enough and a bit social, but comfortable if you want to sit by yourself in peace or have a conversation with a friend.The food is good. It's simple but flavorful, and you can taste that the ingredients are of a solid quality.   I'm definitely a fan of the chicken pot pie, which has an interesting ""crust,"" is nicely seasoned and avoids the common pot pie sin of excessive saltiness.It's just a bit too pricey for my tastes, and it's strange to me that someplace would get such acclaim for making American food with fresh American ingredients... in the American capital.  But, the food is good, the drinks are awesome, the vibe is comfortable, and the service is decent (remarkably good at the bar, mostly good but with some flaws for table service).  Pretty good, overall."
Bobby M.,"Manhasset Hills, NY",8/28/2017,5.0,"Beautiful farm to table ambienceVery busy, seated us 25 mins after our reservation but gave us free apps.Food was deliciousGreat find!"
Kristian D.,"Land Park, Sacramento, CA",8/9/2016,5.0,"Yes, Founding Farmers does live up to all the hype. With all the other ethnic and specialty food available in the District, there is a reason a restaurant specializing in traditional American cuisine is popular and packed. Their modern and surprisingly open and airy restaurant is on Pennsylvania near the White House.There is no ramen here, nor are there any Korean-fusion tacos on the menu. This is a place for pot roast, fried chicken, and other Sunday dinner classics done extremely well served with an excellent selection of specialty cocktails and other libations. On my trip I chose the Yankee Pot Roast and was simply blown away. One of the best pot roasts out there hands down - tender meat, perfect gravy, delicious vegetables and fried onions. I tried a specialty cocktail with ginger and rye where the spicy aspects of both complimented each other, but I probably would not order it again.The staff was warm and welcoming, even for a random tourist with no reservation. You might even sit next to a lobbyist meeting with someone important negotiating a trade bill or tax exemption! If you enjoy food, you should try Founding Fathers for American food done right."
Day W.,"Waldorf, MD",7/11/2017,5.0,"Let me tell you now, please make a reservation or you'll be waiting forever. That cornbread was to die for and my shrimp and grits was everything. The staff and atmosphere was great. Highly recommend to others!!!"
Mary L.,"Mebane, NC",7/18/2017,5.0,Enjoyed dinner and drinks before seeing the Sound Of Music.  The restaurant was highly recommended to us by the Marriot.   Good choice.
Sarita P.,"Long Island, NY",2/21/2017,4.0,"I made reservations the day before on Open Table because I knew it would be packed. My favorite part of the meal were the beignets, so frikin delicious. The eggs Benedict were good as well except they were served lukewarm. I think this place is cool, I don't know that I'd be willing to get on a ridiculously long waiting list to eat here but with reservations I'd definitely pay them another visit."
Nina F.,"Boston, MA",4/23/2017,4.0,"Came to celebrate a birthday celebration.my friend has been recommending this place for years, it his favorite place to go for brunch. when I came they were just serving lunch. I started with a blueberry drink , the bartender recommended it to me and it was delicious!!!!! it contains egg whites so I was a little reserved about ordering it but im lad that I did. the bartender was so friendly and very accommodating, watching him make drinks was like a show.For appetizer we got corn bread and pepper wings, the cornbread was moist and flavorful, the wings were delicious and super flavorful!!!!!!  I ordered the crispy shrimp with a side of corn bread and mac and cheese. The shrimp were great, really big and tasty, and came with alot but the mac and cheese was just normal, I was expecting it to taste a lot better. the environment was really nice and festive. especially the bathrooms they were awesome, ill let you discover that on your own,lol. id for sure return for brunch I feel like the menu options and food is a little better."
Jennifer W.,"Washington, DC",3/4/2017,4.0,"Popular D.C. restaurant chain featuring quintessential American fare.-FOOD: Founding Farmers offers an array of favorite American dishes - chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, sandwiches, salads, etc. I had the cranberry and brie veggie burger (because I can't resist the combination of brie and cranberry) with a side of carrots and pearl onions. The burger was pretty filling, though much of it was the brioche bun - be sure to pack some mints because there are a pile of onions on the veggie patty! We also split an order of fried green tomatoes which were exactly what they sound like - battered and deep fried tomatoes served with a very tasty cilantro cream sauce and what I believe was a goat cheese sauce.-VEGETARIAN OPTIONS: Founding Farmers has a special section on the menu just for vegetarian entrees, including the veggie burger I had and cauliflower steak (which I have also had and which is nothing like steak). There are also salads and several vegetarian appetizers, like the fried green tomatoes. If you have other dietary restrictions, like gluten, the wait staff seems very receptive to working with you to find a dish that fits your needs.-SERVICE: The service was friendly and attentive, and patient as we spent more time talking at the beginning of our meal and kept needing time extensions before we ordered. -AMBIENCE: The ambience is somehow casual, modern, and rustic at the same time. It's an open floor plan and becomes *very* crowded around meal times, so expect some noise and reserve a table in advance (or be prepared to wait)."
Camille F.,"Berkeley, CA",6/14/2017,3.0,"This place is fine, it's a decent brunch, but nothing extraordinary. First, the coffee is expensive even if it does include refills. We got the peanut butter banana toast, which was good, but nothing we couldn't make at home - it was literally bread with peanut butter, bananas, and fancy chocolate chips. Should have gone with the beignets. I got the sausage, mushroom, spinach pan egg scramble with the potatoes. The two tasted great mixed and the cheese was good. The potatoes were nothing special and there were barely any leeks. Portion size was large.Maybe this place is extraordinarily fresh and exquisite relative to other brunch places in the area, but it's very average, at least coming from the Bay Area. At 25$ a person for brunch with tip, there are better brunches in dc."
Derek Y.,"New York, NY",8/7/2016,5.0,"After seeing and eating at many highly reviewed restaurants on Yelp, and being mildly to severely disappointed by many of them, I was skeptical that I, too, would provide yet another five star review to Founding Farmers. All doubt would be crushed as soon as the first bite of food hit my tongue.It was a true relief to walk into the restaurant at 2:30pm today, relieving ourselves from the 90 degree heat and bright, shining sun. The first floor's layout is open, though crowded, and while we were advised that brunch would not be served anymore, it seemed that the brunch crowd hadn't completely left. My girlfriend and I were advised that without a reservation our wait would be 30-45 minutes. After 20 minutes, we checked again and were promptly seated.Jose took care of us today, and he was excellent. Attentive and knowledgable, he deftly walked us through the large menu. We couldn't help ourselves and we both got the chicken and waffles, which comes with mac and cheese (we were both okay with it, so I can't say if this is non-negotiable) and one other side. She chose the mint watermelon and I got the mashed potatoes. We also shared a corn bread skillet.The appetizer arrived first and I couldn't help but be excited. The corn bread was very fluffy, and there was even kernels of corn inside! I've never seen such a thing, but I'm glad they included it because the kernels were pretty sweet and added a new textural dimension to what would be an ordinary and traditional dish. Our entrees arrived next, and again, I was stoked. The plates are very large, and I couldn't even finish my own entree! For $16 per entree, this is definitely a good deal (especially since I'm accustomed to NYC prices). I usually don't eat the skin on fried chicken, but this was an exception. The chicke wasn't dry, the waffles were soft, the mac and cheese was cooked closer to al dente and the mashed potatoes had good body and flavor. Another waiter had actually brought out our dishes and given me green beans instead of mashed potatoes, so Jose hooked me up with complimentary mashed potatoes after I brought it to his attention.I must say that I didn't particularly enjoy my girlfriend's mint watermelon side. It was refreshing, but could've been more so had they been cold instead of a touch above room temperature, and if there were more than 5ish pieces. All in all, though, this place deserves a 5/5. Great service, delicious food, excellent ambience. You'll leave feeling full -- perhaps a bit too full -- and happy!"
Krista L.,"Upland, CA",8/19/2017,5.0,"We went here for dinner and now I know why it has such good reviews. The service, food, and atmosphere were great. It is definitely lively so if you're looking for a quiet dinner I'd go elsewhere but that is what I loved about it. We had the bacon lollies (bacon on a stick...how can you go wrong?!), the chicken and waffles, and rotisserie chicken. All were good. The mac and cheese was perfection too. Definitely make a reservation. Without one you'll be waiting a long time for a table."
Juliette J.,"Fort Lee, NJ",8/16/2016,3.0,"**Brunch Review Only**One thing's for sure, if you don't have a reservation, well, good luck.Secondly, prepare to take whatever time they have available. Ours was 9am. And if you're thinking, well, maybe I can call and change that rezzy to 10a. HA! Not possible! While the rest of the town sleeps, Founding Farmers is bustling with activity, packed to capacity. However, I'm in the minority here. After brunch I quizzically asked myself -- what's the hype?!Don't get me wrong, I like and respect the background story (farm to table food), but the brunch menu left much to be desired. Options were limited and not very creative. Service was on point and we liked our meals, but it wasn't exactly something that we'd show up at 9am for. Anywho, we ordered: - Cafe latte and hot chocolate: both very good, definitely made with love.- Uncle Buck's Beignet with a trio of raspberry, chocolate and caramel sauces: I have a very limited point of reference when it comes to beignets, but these were on par with what I tried before. Nothing outstanding, just enjoyable. I loved it with the caramel sauce.  - Roasted Vegetable Pan Scramble - basically scrambled eggs with veg and cheese.  I chose the farmers salad and grilled ciabatta toast as my sides. The dish was tasty, but again, nothing to write home about. - Banana Foster Pancakes - pretty good. Probably the best dish we ordered. - Chicken Apple Sausage - the Carnivore hated it, so there's that.  Maybe lunch or dinner might be a bit more impressionable, but brunch just didn't do it for us."
Guy R.,"Syracuse, NY",3/22/2017,4.0,"Had a 9:15pm reservation Saturday night, got there early hoping to get sat sooner, but the place was packed. We got sat around 9:25pm. Our server greeted us after a few minutes to get our drink order. She was very friendly.Ordered the Devil ish eggs and fried green tomatoes for appetizers, Both were fantastic, well seasoned and came out quickly. For entrees we had the roasted chicken, fish and chips, ribeye steak and the yankee pot roast. The food came in a reasonable time, my steak was well seasoned and cooked a perfect medium. The brussel sprouts were outstanding. I tasted everyone's dishes and everything was welled seasoned and tasted great.Had to have the beignets for dessert, they came out hot and fresh and were delicious. I would of given them a 5, but in my opinion the service was why I went with a 4, while she was very friendly and nice, I felt she could have been more attentive to the table with drink refills and checking in.Would highly recommend"
Sierra B.,"Forest Grove, OR",8/27/2017,4.0,"One of the best burgers I've had in DC. Personally, I don't like the in-house sodas and the sides weren't that special but the burger was juicy, big, and well-seasoned."
Elina S.,"Chicago, IL",9/20/2016,4.0,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and oh my was it freaking packed. So happy I made a reservation since there was 6 of us and I heard others quoted like a 2 hour wait, so do yourself a favor and make reservations. I can't say the service was the best here as things were brought out at random times but overall we got our food so that's always a plus. For the appetizers we ordered the fried green tomatoes which were very tasty especially in their dipping sauces and then the corn bread in a skillet which was brought out after our entrees which was kind of annoying. Speaking of entrees, I got the fried chicken and waffles with mac and cheese and I thought it was okay. Not as good and hyped up as everyone makes it sound. I wouldn't necessarily order it again but its seriously enough to share with two people it's that big. Then came the corn bread which is a must have. Honestly, it was the best corn bread I've ever had in my life and absolutely amazing with some honey butter. I helped myself to quite a few portions of that because it was seriously the best thing I had there. I wouldn't have given this place a 4 stars but that corn bread totally made up for everything else that I thought was so so. I really wanted to try their much talked about red velvet cake but we were seriously stuffed beyond any proportion so we took a pass on it. Maybe next time. Good brunch spot, probably a necessary place when in D.C. as everything is very fresh. But prepare to wait as they do get busy. Founding farmers thank you for founding your restaurant."
Nicky E.,"Boston, MA",9/19/2016,5.0,"We came here after checking out the Yelp reviews, and Yelp did not do us wrong. This place was MARVELOUS. There was a line outside the door, but they were able to seat us within 10 minutes. My friend got a spicy Bloody Mary, and it was the best Bloody Mary I've ever tasted (and I'm well versed in brunch libations).My friend got the brunch eggs and the crab benedict, and of course, the beignets. The crab Benedict was melty, tender, and so scrumptious. The beignets were light, fluffy, sugary, and amazing. It's probably good that I don't live in DC...I would weigh a million pounds."
Joanne M.,"Westchester County, NY",8/10/2017,5.0,"WOW! This place is great. Our server Sam on Tuesday night was so helpful and attentive. He made us feel as though we were in his own dining room. The food was absolutely everything I'd want and more. Fried green tomatoes, rice and bean burger, cauliflower steak, butternut squash pasta, pickles potato salad, pickled veggies, then we loved it so much we went back the next day for breakfast! Blueberry pancakes, veggies and hash browns, french toast.... I really enjoyed this place. Thank you for wonderful dining experiences."
Danielle K.,"Austin, TX",6/12/2017,5.0,"Totally delicious! The first knock out meal that I had while visiting DC. I had the vegetable loaf, it came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. It was covered with hearty mushroom gravy. This is such an amazing vegetarian option. We also had corn bread, fried green tomatoes and milkshakes. Very tasty all around. The only downsides: initial service was slow, took forever to get a can of coke or the corn bread which was ordered right away. Our waitress also didn't know what was going on, we would ask her questions and she kind of answered but not really. The food was great, well worth the wait.....TIP-brunch ends at 2!"
Bryan E.,"Washington, DC",3/20/2017,5.0,"Took my mom here for her birthday per the recommendation of a coworker. I was a little skeptical because there was a mass of people gathered. Sometimes places don't live up to their own hype. Nonetheless, I kept an open mind. We're  are all standing ( felt like church) good thing we made a reservation. The menu was very versatile and every single item on the menu is organic and house made down to the soda that you drink. No steroids or added preservatives. All this for a decent price, I expected to pay way more for organic dishes but hey I won't complain. I had the garlic black pepper cracked wings . It was my starter but it was so good I ordered more for an entree. Mom we might have a new spit for your birthday every year!"
Nicole C.,"Washington, DC",8/20/2016,4.0,"Last Sunday I had a friend visiting from Australia and we visited Founding Farmer's in DC. I booked a reservation in advance, knowing how crazy this place gets on the weekend. We picked 2:00 because they are usually still serving brunch. When we arrived the place was packed. The hostess told me that they were running just 10-15 minutes behind on reservation seating, which is fine. It happens. I figured it would be a fairly quick wait. Unfortunately I was wrong and we had to ask when we would be seated several times. We were seated close to three only after I mentioned to the hostess that I had to be at the airport around 4:30 to pick my boyfriend up. I was a little annoyed at first, but the manager was nice enough to stop by our table and offer us a cornbread for our inconvenience.Our waiter was wonderful. He made some great drink suggestions and he was very attentive. He checked on us to make sure everything was going well several times. I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup with a side of Mac and Cheese. It was all glorious. I did ask for avocado on my grilled cheese and it was a little bit much for my liking. I really love avocado but it was like a whole half on each side of the sandwich. The food was great, everything just took really long. I felt a little rushed and we weren't out of there until almost 4:00. I would definitely return, just not if I knew I had somewhere to be within a two hour window on the same day. The experience overall was really good - just make sure you have the luxury of time on your side, even with a reservation."
Kirsten J.,"Quincy, MA",7/14/2017,5.0,Fantastic food.  Super accommodating to our table of four adults and four toddlers.  Couldn't ask for much more than that!  Cocktails were all really enjoyable and of all the dishes and side dishes the carrots and the sautéed spinach were my absolute favorites!
Taz W.,"Washington, DC",2/18/2017,4.0,"My husband brought me here for lunch for my birthday. Their food was good (with 1 exception to be listed below). Our server was an absolute delight & our desert donuts were to die for (Note: I have only had hot Krispy Kreme donuts before). My only issue was that I wanted a chicken parm sandwich...I obviously thought this would be a traditional sandwich because when I bit into it...my mouth started burning! This dang sandwich was spicy & I am not a spicy kind of girl lol. Had to send it back. What a shame!The bathrooms were clean, smelled amazing, & made me feel relaxed...not like a normal bathroom, more like a spa bathroom. I actually told my husband to go to the bathroom lol.I would go again."
Tammy C.,"Centreville, VA",1/22/2017,4.0,"Here celebrating my daughter'sBirthday - a packed inauguration weekend but managed to get a reservation last week and here to celebrate . Review summary: great for a food allergy family as they were very attentive to our needs . We had several apps and then salads all around. The bacon pop appetizers were tasty and simple, also dates with blue cheese very good. Farmers salads a bit smaller than expected as my daughter has been here previously and said they were towering . Still, fresh and delicious . However, what was towering was the carrot cake dessert that we split between us over a tasty cup of java. Our waiter was very good and the place was packed ; overall, it was a nice evening celebration with healthy fare."
Douala H.,"Berkeley, CA",6/29/2017,3.0,"My sister was raving about this place so we decided to give it a shot. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the menu has some amazing vegetarian options. I stuck to the basics, cheeseburger fries. The lemonade was refreshing. The service was ok. The price was very good for the location. Their is nothing unique about this experience. If my review is boring you to death, it's because this place is."
Josh R.,"Washington, DC",8/31/2017,2.0,"Most expensive Coca-Cola in DC! $4 for a 12 ounce can. Must be why you can't find the price listed on the menu. This is literally the most expensive Coke I have ever had. Ever. The wait was pretty long - probably about 45 minutes on a Thursday night.  I ordered a medium-rare ribeye and found it a bit tough, overcooked, and sliced thin. My wife said the chicken and waffles were pretty good, although the syrup was served cold. If you do eat here, stick with DC's finest tap water!"
Nathan L.,"Evanston, IL",8/3/2016,5.0,"Ok this place is a must go to if you're in Washington DC I got a cocktail but immediately regretted it ($12) as it was more expensive than my dessert, which was a massive chocolate mousse cake. It was also more expensive than my friends prosciutto flatbread appetizer ($9) EVERYTHING IS SOOOOO GOOD OMG. Portions are reasonably sized and, if you don't go crazy, you can have a well priced meal for under $20. Had I gotten an appetizer and a dessert, I would've been well under $20. And let me say, THE DESSERT CHOCOLATE CAKE IS MASSIVE AND SOOOO GOOD. JUST LOOK AT MY PICTURE There's a reason why there's 8,000 reviews of this restaurant and still has a 4 stars. It's a magnet restaurant. The interior is neat and clean, and the service is friendly. They leave a water pitcher for you to fill your own water up, which is nice as all the waiters and waitresses are hustling all over the big establishment to tend to customers. We had trouble picking what we wanted to eat, but honestly, everything on the menu looks so good. We ordered beignets, two burger, apple pie, prosciutto flatbread, and a chocolate mousse cake. Everything was made to perfection and at the end, we were all pregnant with food babies. As I clutched my stomach, left arm on the table, I could feel my consciousness about to leave me. But alas, I shook off my drowsy state since I still needed to pay the bill. The average for ordering an (appetizer + main course) and (main course + dessert) came out to be around $25 which is well priced. I would love to come back and eat myself to death again. But yeah stay away from cocktails. I'm sure they're used with quality alcohol but just not worth in my opinion (the amount I got was very small as well)"
Gerard T.,"Milwaukee, WI",7/27/2016,5.0,"Shout out to my friend from high school that suggested a few very very nice places that our work team loved.... this was the best breakfast that we had while we were in DC for our annual work conference. I was specifically told to order the chicken and waffles with the chicken strips. The waffle was perfecto !!! Crispy on the outside with a warm yummy inside. The chicken strips could have been bigger but they were DELISH as well. The maple cinnamon syrup was an amazing compliment. Also it came with white gravy and scrambled eggs. If you like your eggs scrambled harder tell your server. The beverages included Manhattan Soda, coffee, espresso, agave and jerk soda, with whipped cream. Tasted almost like a coffee espresso soda . The Rickey for the day was Mango Rickey, mango and lime juice, jerk soda, etc. My coworker had the ranch steak and eggs. She said everything was DELISH as well. She liked her eggs scrambled a little harder so that was her only suggestion. Also if you want to come here on the weekend for brunch, call a couple days or a few days ahead because I heard this place gets crowded fast. Definitely will be back here next time I'm out this way...."
Eden B.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",2/17/2017,5.0,"Another delicious meal in D.C.  One of the best brunches I've ever had. From the oatmeal to the banana peanut butter toast, my mouth couldn't stop watering.  I definitely recommend those two things, for sure.  Also- got my own framers breakfast which was great: any eggs, meat, bread, and then a choice for another side dish. Everything was great!!"
Tia N.,"Washington, DC",8/8/2017,5.0,This is one of the first restaurants that I tried in D.C. and it did not disappoint! They were extremely busy when we arrived but found a way to get us seated almost immediately. I ordered the rotisserie chicken with the seven cheese macaroni. I honestly could have just eaten the mac n cheese but the chicken was perfectly done! To top it all off the beer (of the week or day??) was very cold and refreshing.
Alissa M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/27/2017,4.0,"We had to make a reservation two days in advance for a spot here and were in the restaurant for a total of two hours. Trust me, it was worth it.Our original reservation was for 8:15pm on a Monday night. We arrived a little early just in case we could get in earlier. We ended up getting a table at around 7:50 because the party before us didn't have all their guests ready so we took their table and they took ours.Anyway, moving on to the food and the service. Our waitress informed us it was her first day but she was very sweet and kept checking up on us. For an appetizer, we ordered the skillet cornbread. For only five bucks, we indulged in maybe the best cornbread I've ever had. It had a nice amount of actual corn pieces inside and the sea salted honey butter included was great as well. We placed our entree orders and waited. Forty minutes passed and we were still waiting. Finally, a little while later, our food arrived and it looked delicious. Thankfully, it also tasted delicious! My dish, the chicken and waffles, was a great choice. The chicken was crispy without being too overly battered and also nice and moist. There was a weird white sauce next to them that I tried and didn't like (it had no flavor) so I just left it there. The waffles were incredibly fluffy and the maple syrup had cinnamon sticks inside and had great flavor. The mac and cheese wasn't spectacular but not bad. I didn't touch the green beans because I was already so full from everything else on the plate plus I'm not really a fan of green beans. The candied lemon was a nice touch though. The rest of my family had nothing bad to say about their meals. Moving on to dessert, we ordered one scoop of vanilla ice cream and warm cookies. Fast forward another half hour or so and we are still waiting. How long does it take to prepare a scoop of ice cream and cookies? I get that everything is fresh, but were they literally hand churning the ice cream and baking the cookies from scratch AFTER we ordered? Because it took so long that I wouldn't be surprised if that was actually the case. The ice cream was average and the cookies were good, you could taste they were homemade. Overall, I'm glad we were able to get a reservation and dine here on our last night in DC. If we were ever to come back to the area we would definitely eat here again."
Kartik K.,"Rahway, NJ",7/3/2017,5.0,"This place is baller. Great food and drinks all around. I got the deviled eggs which were okay and the green fried tomatoes which were insane. I got the pork chops which were really well executed and then the vanilla bean cheesecake to top it off. I also had the something fraise cocktail which was the perfect summer cocktail. Highly recommended - but get a reservation, otherwise be prepared to wait a long time."
Andrew W.,"Washington, DC",3/9/2017,5.0,"I had heard some bad things about this place so I was a bit worried -- it's a giant place and that's not always a good sign. However, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The mains were great, the bread things (I forget the name, various delicious bread with toppings) were excellent, and the cocktails were tasty too. I got gnocchi and sampled my buddy's apple and ham mac and cheese, all solid, hearty and delicious -- which makes sense from a farmer-owned place.Our waiter was really funny and nice as well. Great for big groups (though get reservations), especially if you're downtown for work stuff, as I was. A bit noisy, but that's the only real knock I can think of."
Schyler P.,"Seattle, WA",7/23/2016,5.0,"If you're within 30 minutes and you're thinking of a weekend brunch place, come here. (Not just if you happen to be in the area. This deserves a special trip!). Our breakfast was AMAZING. On Thursday when my girlfriends and I were planning where to eat for brunch today (Saturday morning), one of them suggested Founding Farmers DC and decided to call to make a reservation ""just in case"". Well, it's a good thing we did because by the time we called on Thursday, the only time slot left was at 8:45. Good thing it was well-worth waking up early on a Saturday for!Even when we got there, there was a line going out the door filled with people who had made a reservation but it moved quickly. Our server was very nice and so was the whole atmosphere. I didn't want to get a drink but when the server said that they offered fresh-squeezed juice, including pineapple juice, I impulsively ordered the pineapple juice. It was DELICIOUS. It was warm and obviously fresh. It was a pretty small cup for $5 but I thought it was worth it to try. I was looking at the stuffed french toast and went with the Fresh Strawberries & Cream one. WOW was it amazing. It was $10 and a HUGE portion. I thought that this was going to be a place where things were overpriced and small in portion but boy, was I wrong. Because of my previous assumption, I went ahead and ordered chicken sausage a la carte ($6) which was delicious as well. Of the three giant sticks of stuffed french toast and two big sausage links, I ate two of the sticks and half of one sausage link. Everything was delicious but I was stuffed to the brim. Next time, I'll know that just getting one meal is plenty! The vanilla cream that came with the french toast was also heavenly. I would 1000% recommend for breakfast/brunch."
Shia G.,"Boston, MA",5/19/2017,3.0,"We walked in on a busy Friday at 10:40aM in May, graduation season. Reserved through Opentable while in for 11am seated at 11:15. Our waiter was nice with some suggestions one popular drinks and dishes. I got the Ward Eight which was good made from their own distilled whiskey. Food is were the hiccups happened through convo we mentioned having a flight in at 1pm and the good can come out whenever ready. Ordered apps and entrees. Table seated far after us received there food apps two of what we ordered and hot entrees. Our entrees finally came out no apps in sight nearly 30mins later. Our waiter did note he's not sure what happened but didn't offer an apology. We canceled one, no visit from the manager which was visible, no offer to make things right. Not much to say about the food it was okay American fair probably wouldn't go back on my next visit to DC. The Farmers' offerings are not highlighted in the menu, food was ladled with sauces so couldn't say for purity. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose and we definitely lost. Many better places to eat your last DC meal, definitely wouldn't go here to celebrate an event."
Candace H.,"Fairburn, GA",7/20/2016,4.0,"Visiting DC and had this place in mind for lunch. Although we did not have a reservation, we didn't have to wait long for a table (20 min at the most). For lunch, the place was definitely packed. I liked the layout of the restaurant and it was very spacious. The hostess seated my four friends and I upstairs at a cozy booth. I ordered the slow braised beef short rib. It was really tasty and tender. It could have used a little salt and some more of the sauce so that I could have had more with my potatoes; nonetheless, I still enjoyed the dish. The red skin whipped potatoes and green beans were really good too. The fried green tomato appetizer was quite tasty but slightly fried too hard for my liking. Also at the table was the chicken and waffles and the rotisserie chicken. My friend liked her chicken and I liked the chicken and waffles as well. Would definitely come again for lunch next time in DC."
Denise T.,"Washington, DC",3/6/2017,5.0,"I've lived in D.C. far to long to have not visited FF. The menu had tons of things I would have loved to try, and I will definitely be back to try them. I had two delicious cocktails there too. They also have a very well stocked bar. Downsides- this location has very little space to wait which is slightly annoying, but I guess that means more tables. Super touristy- which means it super busy and active even on weekdays. I would recommend making a reservation."
Donald S.,"Boston, MA",7/12/2016,3.0,"3.5 rounding down. You seldom see a place with more reviews than Founding Farmers. Non stop dining traffic, Almost impossible to get a table without a reservation, even at 1pm in the middle of the week. Perhaps it's the proximity to the White House. First of all, the exterior is quite deceptive. This is a beautiful space, great layout, cool decor. This had all the makings of a beautiful fairytale.....enters the food. Hit or miss can best describe my experience. Had a chance to taste several offerings:The goodDeviled eggs: well done. No complaints here. Creamy, tasty, as it should be Bacon lollis: quite creative. Bacon already taste good on its own, this elevates it to addictive levelsFried green tomatoes: point blank the best fried green tomatoes I've ever had. Super crispy breadcrumb coated The rest:Chicken and waffles: mediocre at best. Nothing stood out. Ok waffle paired with ok chicken. Mac and cheese: ginormous mistake. No salt, no pepper, no particular seasoning. Bland bland bland. Not really sure penne rigata was the right pasta choice...Brie flatbread: apple and Brie always works, it's fundamental. Unfortunately The flatbread in this case was not a tasty vehicle. Oh what could have been...."
Sonia N.,"Boston, MA",7/12/2016,4.0,"After trekking up and down the National Mall all morning, FF was like a garden oasis in the DC desert.  Take heed though and make a reservation.  We stopped by right around 1pm for brunch/lunch and the wait quoted was about an hour.  Luckily, we had one and they were able to seat us right at our reserved time.Famished, we decided to go with something a bit heavier.   For starters, we shared the amazing fresh farm bread with pesto.  Very large serving of freshly chopped basil and tomatoes and ohh, I just loved all the pine nuts.  So very generous with the toppings, it was just what we needed.   For entrees, we shared the Shrimp & Sundried Tomato Bucatini and the Spicy Ahi Tuna Poke salad.   Both were quite tasty but my body was screaming ""give me carbs!"" that day.  The bucatini hit the spot as the pasta was thick enough to pick up all the tasty sauce with the perfectly cooked shrimp and the sundried tomatoes gave it that smoky savory flavor that I'm so fond of.   The tuna salad was a nice healthy choice that helped offset all the other more filling choices and we left happy, satiated and ready for more DC tourist action."
Cynthia T.,"San Francisco, CA",8/24/2017,5.0,Grits and shrimp was amazing. Ingredients so fresh and the shrimp was sweet. Chicken pot pie crust is not your typical crust...it was delightful. Definitely going back to try the rest of the menu the next time I'm in DC.
Graham B.,"Washington, DC",1/8/2017,3.0,"I need to get a hold of Founding Farmers' publicist, stat. I'm pretty sure that if he or she were working for me, I'd be every bit as popular as Obama in this town. Perhaps it's the general hype surrounding this spot that dampens my own enthusiasm. This restaurant is consistently busy, and you can expect a hefty wait during peak times and weekend brunch.While I don't share Sietsema's total disdain for this restaurant, I am a little confused by DC's intense fascination with this place. There are maybe a dozen restaurants in walking distance of me right now where I would prefer to dine at any given time. But it seems every other month I'm being dragged here by someone who thinks this place is the end-all.I've been a handful of times, and every experience has been pleasant. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is rustic, and the food is always fine. There really isn't anything I can say about the menu that hasn't been articulated in one of the several thousand other reviews on this site. In general, their sandwiches are solid and the cornbread is a consistently delicious starter. It's a fine establishment. And if you're in this city, you kinda have to go, if for no other reason than to be able to contribute when someone in your circle inevitably brings it up in conversation. But it's not the type of place I'd go out of my way for, much less wait in line."
Neko C.,"Washington, DC",3/3/2017,5.0,Their Yankee Pot Roast is a tender piece of heaven smothered in gravy and topped with shoestring onions . FACT.
Meg D.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",8/24/2017,4.0,"Fun, large menu with ambiance to match. The wait tends to be long and crowded, even with reservations, but the food usually does not disappoint."
Thea M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",8/14/2017,3.0,"This place was suggested so we tried it. They're very popular and have long waits. So we decided to go late. Called at 9 and got a 9:30 reservation. By the time we got there, we were able to park on the street directly in front of the door. That was awesome (especially after our last trying-to-find-a-parking-space adventure). When we walked in, the smells were amazing so I thought this is going to be great. Uh...not so much. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't anything that I world want again. And on top of that, they're very pricey. So, my 3 star review is mainly for the freshness. They source locally for almost everything. Plus, a lot is homemade. And, the server was nice. Now...let's get to the food...for starters, we had a devilish eggs seafood combo, with a variety of lobster, crabs, etc. It was just ok. Then, we had a skillet cornbread, infused with corn and served with a honey butter mixture. It was really good. Next, for meals, we had chicken and waffles...nothing special there. Plus, the skin was too salty and the meat wasn't seasoned properly. I had scallops with butternut squash risotto. The scallops were very good...the risotto not so much. And I didn't see nor taste the butternut squash. Finally, we had these New York egg cream drinks that sounded good on paper (with chocolate syrup, milk and jerk soda) but it was not good. Ok, there you have it...my not so good review."
Emily S.,"Cincinnati, OH",8/15/2016,5.0,"I absolutely loved grabbing breakfast at Founding Farmers! It was the perfect way to start the day in DC. Based off other reviews, we made reservations for Saturday morning (it probably was not necessary since we got there so early, but we wanted to avoid any wait time mishaps). We were seated immediately and started to salivate over the menu! I ended up ordering the Bourbon Batter French Toast with a side of Black Pepper Maple Bacon, and my boyfriend got the Beef Pastrami Poached Egg Hash. I do not usually order French toast, but our server made it sound wonderful and it was! The toast was perfectly cooked, and had the greatest hint of sweetness from the powdered sugar + a mouth-warming feeling from the bourbon. The bacon was thick, and again, cooked to perfection. It did have large black pepper crumbles and a little too much of them in some bites, but it was easy to brush what was unwanted off. The Beef Pastrami Poached Egg Hash was equally delicious! Overall, Founding Farmers was a great beginning to the day in DC! The ambiance, the local area, the service, and most importantly, the food, will leave you wishing you could return each morning!"
Juliet P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1/2/2017,5.0,"Our family came here for lunch and thankfully there was no wait on a Friday at around 1 p.m.! There were several parties ahead of us whose members weren't all there so we got to skip the line! So make sure either your party is all there or make a reservation ahead of time because the line was out the door by the time we finished eating. Anyway, I took my family here since it was the most Yelped place in D.C. and the food looked delicious. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles ($16), which came with mac and cheese and your choice of sides. My dish was super delicious and the chicken was perfectly crunchy and juicy at the same time! My sister got the Lobster Mac and Cheese ($28) and she was hesitant at first since it's pricier at other places but once she got her dish, I realized it is like 3 times bigger than other places and there was a ton of lobster inside! The lobster mac was probably the best I've ever had. My bf got the Chicken Bolognese Bucatini ($18) and this pasta dish was absolutely amazing. There is a mix of red sauce on the inside and white sauce on the outside so you never really get sick of the dish while you're eating it. My dad got the Shrimp and Sundried Tomato Bucatini ($19) and the Roasted Tomato Soup ($6), and both were great too. My mother got the Baby Cheeseburgers (comes in 3 for $10 or 6 for $15). I was too full to give this a try but everyone else who tried it said it was very good. Anyway, I can see why this restaurant is so popular among people in D.C! The portions were massive and we had to take half of our food to-go. But more importantly, everything that we ordered was just delicious and amazing. There wasn't a single complaint with any of our choices, which is rare when all five of us dine together since we all have such different preferences! If you're visiting D.C., then definitely give this place a try and you won't regret it."
Paisley B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/6/2016,4.0,"Forget about reservations. Grab a seat at the bar. Our bartender was awesome. He knows his drank for sure and kept this place going all night. Really stellar service.What to order? You better get the cornbread. You won't taste anything else like it. It has a soft, cake-y, texture with soft corn kernels.The cobb salad is huge...actually...all the portions are huge. And, I'm sorry, but I thought the steak and enchilada was a rather unexpected mix. But oh ...it was so good! Those enchiladas are fantastic. The steak was a bit rough. The brie and apple flatbroad was so-so. Everything else is top notch. Ambiance is fun but not fancy schmancy. Show up after a long day. Wear jeans. Wear shorts. I mean, you can swagger in with your cufflinks if you want to and all."
Blake B.,"Charlotte, NC",6/6/2017,5.0,Wow what a fantastic brunch spot. Was visiting for the weekend and have to say this place really did it for me.  I had the French toast and a mocha and the French toast was incredible as it was very innovative in its design and presentation (see pics).  The mocha was also beautifully presented and delicious. I could tell that they used very high quality ingredients as I expected giving the farm to table promise but tasting the eggs and bacon made me understand what I've been missing in true farm to table experience.  You can't quite fake the honest to goodness purity of no additives and preservatives and it's a truly exceptional experience that you can do every time here and every one should take advantage of that.  Will be back every time I'm within 50 miles.
Charmaine C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",2/25/2017,4.0,"Despite having made a reservation and arriving on time, we ended up waiting at least 15 mins to be seated at founding farmers, and longer still for our food after we ordered. The waiting area wasn't exceptionally pleasant either; it was pretty frenetic and disorderly with no place to perch neatly/patiently out of the way. However, the food did not disappoint. Chicken and waffles: chicken was seasoned exceptionally with salt and pepper, waffles were the lightest I've ever tried. The white gravy it came with did not add much though; it was pretty tasteless. Crab cakes (from the lunch menu): At $30 for 2 crab cakes and sides, we expected this to be packed with crab and it WAS. Best crab cakes I've ever tasted, especially with their seasoning with a bit of hollandaise. This came with 2 sides - the brussel sprouts with maple was just so-so, but the mashed potatoes were to die for. Steak and eggs: Ordered steak medium rare and it came with a good sear outside but lovely and rare but warm inside! Very ""worth it"" option. Sausage, mushroom and spinach pan scramble: I found this just so-so, but my friend seemed to like it. For the last two dishes, we had leek hash as a side, which was amazing. Please try it too!"
Allison C.,"Glen Allen, VA",8/24/2016,4.0,"Founding Farmers always satisfies my appetite. I went on opentable.com and made my reservation there. I arrived with my party about 20 minutes early on a weekday and they were able to seat me. The restaurant is tight! There are a million tables and this location is always packed during the week. Food/orders: lemonade for my drink (YUM). The table appetizer was the skillet cornbread. I LOVED it because it's a mix of corn bread and corn pudding. The others at my table weren't so impressed because there were actual pieces of corn in the bread. This is served with honey butter (mix-it-yourself). I ordered an egg salad sandwich with the green beans. I wasn't in the mood for something heavy but didn't want a salad either. This was be perfect inbetweeny meal. My sister ordered the chicken and waffles with Mac and cheese. The Mac is pretty good! The waffle was fluffy and surprisingly not too heavy for a Belgian waffle. Lastly, my parents (both) ordered a fried chicken salad. My mom boasted that it was so fresh she didn't even need salad dressing. Service was great! Food was wonderful! I would never choose to walk in without a reservation, but overall this is a great spot to dine!!"
Jocelyn C.,"Washington, DC",7/10/2016,3.0,"+1: Plenty of reservations available as long as you make them at least 2 weeks in advance. We booked a table for 4 for Saturday, prime time with no issue. +1: Ambience: Communal and inviting. All the guests look ecstatic to try what they ordered, and the tourists bring even more energy and joy when they gawk at the beauty of the interior design. +1: Beignets...Order them. Served with a sweet raspberry compote, chocolate ganache, and caramel. They're made fresh to order and come warm. -2: Taste was rather mediocre (besides the beignets). We ordered the bananas foster stuffed French toast and Tomato florentine Benedict. The French toast was luke warm and rather soggy. The hollandaise was weak and the muffins were too lightly toasted. To end on a good note, you could taste the quality in ingredients."
Marcelo B.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6/22/2017,4.0,"Overall, pretty good!! Service was on point, food came out fairly quick. The sandwich I ordered was really good, the mussels were delicious, especially the broth!!Will definitely come back to taste something else on the menu!"
Jacquelyn W.,"Silver Spring, MD",1/11/2017,4.0,"My friend and I came here for dinner before heading to the Kennedy Center to see Into the Woods. I had been here for brunch before, but never for dinner. Their brunch was pretty solid, but I had heard great things about their lunch/dinner menu. We started off with drinks. I can't recall what my friend ordered, but I had the Islay Swizzle whiskey cocktail (monkey shoulder, mahina coconut, lemon, passionfruit, bitters, lagavulin 16yr). It was a very interesting fruity blend that I don't think you usually see with whiskey. It wasn't overbearingly sweet either, which I enjoyed.We skipped appetizers and went straight entrees. I had the fish of the day (arctic char) MEUNIÈRE style (butter, shallots, garlic, lemon) with maple pecan sweet potato and green beans. The arctic char was really flavorful and tasted very good. The sweet potatoes and green beans were also really good. My friend ordered the scallops MEUNIÈRE which came with butternut risotto. She said the scallops were perfectly cooked and tasted great. The butternut risotto was also quite delicious. Even though there were a lot of flavors in all the food, we both agreed that the food seemed under seasoned. That being said, a little salt and pepper always does the trick.Final course was dessert. Not something I usually go for, but since my friend was going for it, I figured I'd try it. She had the red velvet cake and I had the apple pie. Both were very very good. I'd actually go back for the pie because it was pretty tasty.One thing I STRONGLY recommend is making a reservation. Weekend brunch is virtually impossible to get in without a reservation and even a Wednesday night dinner would've been rough had we not had a reservation. It's best to have everyone there at the reservation time too because they will not seat you unless everyone is there. I would definitely enjoy coming back here again for brunch or lunch/dinner in the future."
John P.,"Atlanta, GA",6/28/2017,5.0,"Had an excellent experience here. Had a reservation set for 5pm, we arrived about 10 mins early and were escorted upstairs to our table about 2 mins after arriving. Doesn't get much better than that. We even had an extra person with us that I did not include in the reservation, and it was no problem at all. Our waiter was super nice and patient, and was very good at explaining everything about the restaurant and menu. The food was just as impressive as the service. You HAVE to order the deviled eggs as well as the skillet cornbread as a pre meal appetizer for the entire table. They were delicious. The beef short ribs were fork tender, and I tried some of the pork ribs from someone else in our party and they were even more delicious. The pork ribs are a must try here. Parking was very easy for us on a Sunday evening. We parked on a side street behind the restaurant at a meter that you don't have to pay for on Sunday. Overall, this was an excellent experience and I will definitely add this place to the must visit list each time im in DC."
Sirushi W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6/17/2017,4.0,"Not sure I can give this place a fair review because I only had a cup of coffee and the Parfait, but both were good. The granola in my parfait was amazing.I walked in, found a place at the bar, sat right down and got really good service. (The wait for a table for a party of 1 {One} was 1.5 hours so you get an idea of how popular this place is). They had really good breakfast options on the menu, especially if you like eggs."
Marina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/6/2016,4.0,"Whether you believe the hype or not, this is a great spot for American comfort food in DC. As pretty much every review mentions, definitely make a reservation; you don't want to end up waiting 2 hours for a table (although there's plenty of sightseeing opportunities in the area if you do).We came for a late brunch on a Saturday, and were extremely glad we bypassed the wait. Despite the place being extremely crowded, our server was really nice and helpful, and definitely at the top of her game.Unfortunately they didn't have their kettle corn during brunch, so we started with the cornbread. O. M. G. I'm not exaggerating when I say this was the best thing I ate in DC all weekend. It's baked to order in a mini cast iron skillet, perfectly crispy around the edges, chock full of juicy corn kernels, and served with a delicious honey butter. We scraped the skillet clean and I would heartily order this again for any meal of the day.I had the roasted veggie scramble with grits and an english muffin for my main, which was pretty good but just couldn't compare to the cornbread. The eggs and veggies were a little watery and under-seasoned, while the grits were still a little hard. The homemade english muffin was really delicious though, and perfect with homemade strawberry compote. In any case, I still licked my plate clean.We didn't try dessert, but their MASSIVE red velvet cake looked incredible, and I'd love to try their fresh beignets. And on an unrelated note, it's worth a trip to the (women's) restroom on the top floor to read the amusing quotes on the walls about courtship.Definitely stopping by for dinner next time I'm in DC, especially for that amazing cornbread!"
Ladel L.,"Oxon Hill-Glassmanor, MD",8/5/2017,4.0,"Please make reservations! Without them, you will be waiting a lifetime. But once you're seated, your food comes out rather quick. I had their chicken and waffles. The portions were not outlandishly huge, but I left satisfied. No regrets. But I will be hungry again soon. Duane, our server is what made it a string 4!"
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",6/26/2016,4.0,"4 1/2 stars. Made it here before my flight departed back to the west coast. It was a Saturday morning and it a short walk from the hotel I was staying. No reservations meant dining at the bar which was  at capacity. We had breakfast at our hotel but heard so much hype about Founding Farmers we had to stop in. Just sitting at the bar mid am was entertaining people watching and observing the bartenders prepping  fresh condiments from scratch. We ordered the fried chicken, waffles & eggs and ended up also ordering Uncle Bucks beignets which came with three yummy sauces of raspberry, caramel and chocolate. Both entrées were delicious, the fried chicken white meat was light and grease less and the beignets were bomb.The service was solid and friendly from the entire staff and I would definitely return here next time I'm in DC."
Lauren G.,"Columbia, MD",7/14/2017,5.0,The service was friendly and super quick. Our waitress Daiya gave great recommendations for the stuffed French toast and crab benny. I will be back soon!
Phoevin M.,"Chicago, IL",7/14/2017,5.0,This is prob my favorite brunch spot. Their food is delicious. Best chicken waffles I've ever had. This place is always packed. Gotta make reservations
Jake A.,"San Diego, CA",7/3/2016,5.0,"I've been to Founding Farmers approximately 7 times, just about every chance I get when I visit DC. The food is some of the best you'll get in the entire city. I won't comment too much on the culinary side of things, the entrees speak for themselves. My review is primarily based on my experience with the bar staff.I have a pretty solid interest in classic cocktails, and I tend to be drawn towards complex drinks. All the bartenders that we met there are extremely talented. If you know anything about cocktails, Founding Farmers brings their A-game. However, one of the most legit bartenders that we have ordered from (out of the many classic bars we've been to) is Natalie. I asked her to make me a complex drink, and it was outstanding. We asked for multiple (out of the norm) drinks, and she knew her stuff. She even added her own flare to it so to speak. Advice for the General Manager, if Natalie isn't running your bar program, you should sincerely  consider giving her the spot. Side Note: best Ramos Gin Fizz I have ever had."
Nicole F.,"Delaware, OH",7/11/2016,5.0,"Absolutely amazing! The place came as a recommendation from others and I'm so glad it was suggested. I called on a Monday night at 5:45 to see what the wait was and it was just 20 minutes. Got there around 6:15 and it ended up being less, but I know the line was out the door by the time I left after 7.Had a good beer, and was really impressed by the in house sodas! Today's special soda was mandarin. Split a cornbread, which was phenomenal! The whole pieces of corn were fresh, it all melted in my mouth and the butter... O.M.G the butter! It's a honey sea salt butter and the little crunches of salt just MADE it! My chicken and waffles entree came with mac and cheese and then I added peas and cucumbers as my extra side. Everything was just amazing! Perfect polite service, delicious food, fresh ingredients. Definitely a place I'd recommend to others and return to!"
Elle F.,"Detroit, MI",6/16/2017,4.0,"Make reservations, if you don't the wait is EASILY an hour, if not more and they have very little seating to accommodate the wait. The food, drinks and atmosphere are all good. I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup on my last visit. The grilled cheese was on texas toast and was delicious."
Duane D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1/9/2017,4.0,"Feel lucky if you're able to grab a seat at a table or booth if you're coming for a meal at Founding Farmers. I know my fiance and I did when we were looking for a good spot to get brunch or a Sunday morning. We scored 2 seats on a long communal table and only had to wait 5 minutes after walking through the turn style entrance. The decor has a rustic vibe with industrial elements like a hidden bar area closed by a barn door, large jars of pickled vegetables abound and old school light bulb fixtures straight out of the 1700s hanging throughout. The restaurant actually has seating on a second floor as well. I ended up getting a brunch dish that is quite common in the south, Chicken & Waffles. I just had to. It was the dish recommended by the server and by a vast majority of yelpers who have posted reviews on this restaurant. The waffle was light and crispy and the syrup served with it was light and not overly sweet to take away from the flavor of the chicken. I admit I was skeptical when the server mentioned the chicken was served in chicken strip form but make no mistake, these don't come from a bag and are not overly coated. The seasoning was just right and and had enough crunchy bits and was moist with every bite. The only downside to the dish was the small portion of white gravy that came on the side. Served in nothing more than the size of a 2 oz. container it was hardly enough to last the entire meal let alone I was practically finished with it 3 bites in. Nonetheless, the meal itself is rather generous for a brunch portion and is sufficient to start your day.Oh by the way, my fiance had the Bananas Foster Stuffed French Toast and it was AMAZING. How they do it I am intrigued. I was totally expecting slices of french toast with a bananas foster filling. None of that here as the plate presentation pretty much looks like edible Jenga! 4 pieces of bar shaped French Toast stuffed with pastry creme and topped with caramelized bananas and sauce. My favorite part of enjoying in the sharing were the end pieces as they had the perfect crunchiness to stand up to soaking it in the caramelized sauce. I'll be getting this or another version of the Stuffed French Toast on a future visit for sure!""One restaurant about food, at the table, with creativity and deliciousness for all!"""

Updated review",5.0,"We were disappointed to discover that their famous breakfast isn't served after 2 pm, but their lunch/dinner menu helped to ease the pain.Everything tasted majorly fresh, yes, even straight from the farm.  The Chicken Pot Pie and Chicken and Waffles (with green beans and mac n cheese) were fantastic.My wife never gets excited by these types of foods, but even she gobbled it all up and loved every bit.  It was impressive enough to bring us back the next morning for breakfast.The breakfast was arguably the best breakfast we've ever had at any restaurant (and that is no small feat).  Everything was delicious, EVERYTHING.  Even sides as simple as eggs and hash browns had a fresh, satisfying taste that eludes most restaurants.  The thick cut bacon is a must.  And the Strawberries and Cream stuffed French toast is out of this world."
Saeed D.,"Syracuse, NY",12/27/2016,5.0,"I had an amazing experience here. If I say I want to give them 6 starts, I haven't lied.they were super busy, but the staff managed people with respect and patience and they didn't jeopardize their quality of service.I didn't have any reservation, so they offered me to sit at the bar if any seat became available. I was lucky enough to get seat at the bar. I started with an Irish Cream, which has been the best Irish Coffe that I 've had so far. they use premium liquor and bartender shook the top cream of my drink in a shaker pretty well.food was amazingly tasty and delicious. Beef pot roast was prepared to perfection. excellent mixture of mashed potato, gravy on bottom and crispy onions on top. couldn't be better.I went with safe choice of farmaer platter, which i regeret now, cause they have lots of other amazing options on their menu.I had an absinthe drink too, which was a ery balance taste of absinthe, lime, mint, and ginger. The price is fair and compare to quality of service and food it's the best value of my money that I've ever got."
Christina Z.,"Charlottesville, VA",8/14/2016,4.0,"I love the concept of farm to table, and I feel that Founding Farmer does a good job of embodying this in a big city like DC. We started off with drinks at the bar while waiting for our table - I got the dark and stormy which was bigger than I had expected it would be and not terribly priced at $9 compared to the other cocktails. Based on previous reviews, we tried the deviled eggs and the skillet cornbread. Though the skillet cornbread lived up to the expectations (warm with a good balance of sweet and salty and best with butter on top), I felt that the eggs were nothing special and were your average deviled eggs. For our entrees, we got the short ribs and the crab cakes which came with a choice of 2 sides each. The short ribs were cooked perfectly - so tender (fell apart so nicely), juicy, and well-seasoned. The crab cakes were two decently sized lump cakes - also well seasoned, but definitely pricey. I recommend the red potatoes and green beans for sides. The portions were pretty good and we left stuffed and unable to try any dessert (which looked good with huge portions from the table next to us). Overall, a really good experience!"
Allie G.,"San Diego, CA",8/22/2017,5.0,Amazing food and even better customer service! I came here on vacation with my group of friends and everything was on point. We had a reservation for 8 so we did not have to wait to be seated. Please do yourself a favor and order the pimento farm bread. It is magical.
Michael S.,"Woodstock, VT",2/1/2017,2.0,"I've heard a lot about Founding Farmers and was eager to try it, though based on my meal, I won't be back.I was seated at the bar, where I received friendly and attentive service and appreciated the well-put-together beer list -- and especially the list of wines by the glass. The menu itself has many apparently enticing options, ranging from several types of deviled eggs to other comfort foods including meatloaf and rotisserie chicken, pickles, and many others. I ordered deviled eggs -- a favorite -- and was disappointed at how essentially tasteless they were. The rotisserie chicken was tasteless and even the dark meat was overdone. I tried a few sides and the pickles and nothing stood out. Though one disappointing meal won't usually stop me from going back to a restaurant a second time, I'm sad to say that nothing I experienced would entice me to return. I'll also note, though, that they restaurant was jammed, with walkins waiting for a table or a spot at the bar, so I am forced to wonder what I missed."
Sunni M.,"Hyattsville, MD",5/30/2017,5.0,"Super convenient location when your in the thick of downtown. The space is bright and spacious. Great for groups. As with all of the Founding Farmers, the menu has something for just about everyone. If you go for lunch, let them know you are in a hurry and they will get you in and out in a jiffy."
Jess L.,"Manhattan, NY",8/10/2016,5.0,"Goodness, I don't even know where to start. This place is amazing. I came in with my boyfriend last Sunday afternoon (around 2 PM) and the place was packed. We waited about 25 minutes until we were seated at a table for two and was greeted by our waiter Jose. Jose was friendly, attentive, and really personable. He made us feel comfortable, attended to our needs and answered any questions that we had about the menu.Now, to get to the good part! We order the skillet cornbread and the chicken fried waffles. The cornbread skillet was fantastic! You could find kernels of corn within the cornbread which made it extra delicious and tasty. It also came with a honey butter that I smothered on top of my cornbread. Just thinking about it now makes me so hungry for more...I got the side of mac & cheese and watermelon (sorry Jose didn't love the watermelon...!) with my entree. The mac & cheese was to die for and the chicken fried waffles were the best chicken fried waffles I have ever had. The mixture of gravy and syrup with the perfectly seasoned chicken and waffles was heaven. when I arrived at founding farmers, I was starving. And after having a quarter of the cornbread skillet and half of the chicken fried waffles I was completely stuffed so the portions are pretty generous. I can't wait for my next trip to Washington DC just to go back to founding farmers. I love this place and can't speak more highly of it."
Pam C.,"Atlanta, GA",8/9/2016,3.0,"Great service, would definitely come back. Only 3 stars for a first visit of small snacks, one of which I didn't like...the deviled eggs.  The menu said classic, I asked about pickles which they had none, but way to much onion for me. The Pesto Farm Bread was delicious. The tomatoes were almost too sweet, but oh so good! FYI, at 4:45p.m.on a Tuesday the bar was already packed, I got the last seat!I will say the ppl next to me got the risotto which looked delicious,  maybe next time!"
Deanna F.,"Indianapolis, IN",7/28/2017,4.0,"Jammed packed with people! Expect a long wait. But the wait was worth it. The food was good with great portions, and exceptionally fresh. I even tried their blueberry soda, and it was interesting. The service was also great."

Updated review",4.0,"Still hugely popular, even midweek, so be ready to wait for your reserved table to be ready and to need to speak loudly. This results from good to excellent food combined with good value.The menu should be more detailed about ingredients--the pasta sauce was not specified and was unexpectedly heavy and the pork sandwich came with unexpected and unwanted cheese (but was otherwise excellent). Portions are very generous--especially the cakes. Watch your watch if you have only a 2 hour parking spot, as you will want to take your time here."
Tempris B.,"Houston, TX",4/8/2017,4.0,Visiting the D.C. for the weekends and heard great reviews about the spot. I got the Chicken Salad which was amazing. I like to try different things. Only complaint is the waiter who was a little dry.-Tempting Taste
Nick W.,"Washington, DC",5/21/2017,4.0,"I've been here 3 or 4 times, and have had great experiences, and.. just okay ones. The drinks are excellent, the food is pretty good, the ambiance is nice, and the restaurant is always packed."
Joey L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",8/8/2017,2.0,"I was excited to eat here after seeing the 9100+ reviews on yelp, with most of them being high ratings. All three of us were disappointed with the food, but I guess we were expecting too much.Honestly, this is just a bunch of rambling and me trying to find the words to describe the food. The tl;dr is: food is just average at BEST.We made a reservation just in case, but it was a rainy Monday morning, so they had space for us. When we walked in, we were seated upstairs. I liked how modern it felt inside. I was expecting a great experience.Our waitress was very friendly. We placed our orders of: chicken pot pie, scallop risotto, and a chili burger. We also got two drinks. Both tasted fine, so I nothing bad to say about them, but there was a slight mix up. My friend ordered a cherry soda, but they brought strawberry by accident. No big deal. They quickly replaced it with the correct one. My drink, however, did not arrive until after I had finished eating. The waitress explained that the bar had some printing problems with the tickets, and my order was lost because several hundred tickets finally printed out once the system was working again. I didn't even complain, but she said she'd speak to the manager about it! She was awesome. They didn't charge me for the drink at all. Great customer service and awareness.But most of us are here for the food, right? So my experience with the food was a bit of a letdown, which is why I'm giving two stars.We got the cornbread since it was basically recommended in nearly every review. The cornbread alone is all right. Maybe a bit bland. But once you put the honey butter on it, then it's amazing. Part of me is hesitant to call this good bread when you have to put butter and honey on it, but I'm just nitpicking here. It's $5. Give it a try. The size is about six inches in diameter.I only tasted the chicken pot pie and the scallop risotto, but my friend said that his burger wasn't all that amazing.The chicken pot pie was a bit bland and light (both watery as well as light in seasoning). I'm no food expert, so I'm lacking the adjectives here, but I think what it breaks down to is this: would I ever order it again? No, I wouldn't.I ordered the scallop risotto. The scallops tasted fine. They weren't anything to write home about. Yet, here I am, writing about it. The risotto, on the other hand, was a let down. It was cooked well enough, but there wasn't a lot of flavor. It's quite hard to explain. You know when you eat your grains, and there's seasoning, but you just don't taste much? That's kind of how this risotto tasted.Overall, this experience was not that great. I'm not sure why this place has so many high ratings, but I wish I was there to sample whatever everyone else was eating. However, based on my experience, I would not return. Spend your money elsewhere."
Amanda J.,"Washington, DC",12/9/2016,4.0,"I made it to Founding Farmers as a resident of DC, which seems to be a feat as this is a VERY popular tourist destination.  Founding Farmers is 4 star good, but I don't quite understand the tourism market's fascination with this place either.  Service is excellent and the food is good, but I wouldn't wait in a multi-hour line to come in necessarily either.I came here on a Monday night with a total group size of 3 at 7:30 PM, and we had a half hour wait without a reservation.  We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes ($8) and Skillet Cornbread ($5), and I had the El Presidente ($9) cocktail, which was a sweet and rum based drink.  The green tomatoes were 4 slices of deep-fried tomatoes and good.  The corn bread showed up with the meal so we ended up eating it cold, which was a bummer.  It wasn't great corn bread like you get in the south, though, so I found it to be a bit of a let down.  The drink was very potent, and I have never had such a stiff pour in a restaurant.  That was awesome.For my meal, I ordered the Goat Cheese Ravioli with a Chicken Cutlet ($17).  The ravioli was so rich and came in a sweet sauce with squash underneath.  The chicken was excellent, cooked well and not fatty.  I really enjoyed this meal, although it was immensely heavy.  I didn't eat the entire next day.Our server was really nice and helpful, and he did a great job leading us through choosing options we would like.  This place is very loud, though, so do not come for intimate conversation.All in all, Founding Farmers is good food at low prices for DC.  Don't wait in line for hours to eat here, but it's worth the stop if you are in the area or make a reservation."
Thomas G.,"Charlotte, NC",5/16/2017,5.0,"To start we did not have reservations and the place was packed - finally 2 seats Sachi (not sure of spelling) gave us great recommendations; started with Fried Green Tomato's one of my wife's favorites - it was very good lot of flavor just a hint of red pepper. Then home made farmer cornbread with butter and honey oh this was good; tasted like the picked the corn out back. The the best fried chicken and waffles, the fried chicken was some of the best I have had, an abundant of flavor to standup to the waffle and cream butter Sauce and maple syrup, fresh green beans with candied lemon and penne Mac and cheese. The second was a delicious shrimp and grits - great mix of flavors; fresh shrimp, andouille sausage, fresh onions, and pancetta, I may have missed something as it had so much flavor.  My only regret is that we were so full we couldn't even order one of their homemade desserts - so we decided to come back for dessert for breakfast tomorrow before we leave D.C. - I would come back here in a skinny second.  Great fresh food and great service - nice people."
Valerie P.,"Houston, TX",5/14/2017,3.0,Came for Mother's Day while in town for my Cousins graduation from Howard University. Reserved a table of 4 from OpenTable...easy!!! However we still had to wait 15 mins but that was better than the 1/30 mins I heard them tell the gentleman in front me. Once we were seated...our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable. She suggested the steak and enchiladas as well as the strawberry Fizz...both were good. I mean just good...nothing special or awesome. I received the same reaction across the table. The restaurant is good..nothing that I would say is a must while in DC!!!
Sam W.,"Birmingham, AL",5/25/2017,5.0,"Great spot for a late-night dinner.  The menu appears to be unfocused, as they have a little bit of everything, but it's all executed very well.  Lively atmosphere.  Very good service at the bar.  Crab cakes are the best ever."
Troy S.,"Boston, MA",6/7/2017,4.0,"Make reservations a good while in advance. This place is ALWAYS packed to max capacity.Every time I've gone (n=3) I've been impressed with the staff, atmosphere, and food. The shrimp and grits was probably my favorite, but the chicken pot pie and rotisserie chicken weren't bad either! The side veggies were pretty fresh, but you can't go wrong with the 7 cheese macaroni.I'd recommend this place to others."
Anny Z.,"Marcus Hook, PA",8/20/2017,1.0,"Terrible service. It's been 20 minutes past how long we were quoted to wait for a table (total 50 minutes). In the meantime, they've let various people who arrived after us in, including a couple with the same name as me, who did not have a reservation and arrived after us. Understandably, I am upset. So the hostesses laughed and gestured towards me, while I stood fuming. How is this acceptable behavior? This is rude, demeaning, and horribly reflective of the restaurant as a whole. The rest of the dining experience the hostess continued to glance at us, and when we were seated, said ""I'm sorry"" to the person seating us and looked our way. Food was only mediocre, and did not make up for appalling service!"
Nazli M.,"Miami Beach, FL",8/20/2017,1.0,"AWFUL..... stay away...My husband and I were so excited to try this place out... we went for lunch yesterday but the line was so long that we couldn't get a seat at all. Then we decided to try it for breakfast this morning. Let me tell you that nothing about this place is ""farm"" like... it's a basic diner type place. I ordered 2 eggs with chicken apple sausage and multigrain toast with side of fruit... eggs were ok, I eat organic eggs everyday and I can't say these were.... the toast was smothered in butter. And let's talk about the side of fruit.. this fruit cup was literally scooped and cut days ago ... the apple was getting brown and the grapes in there were anything but the good old purple grape color.. strawberry was easy 2-3 days old. I'm so sad that I forgot to take a picture. This place is a total scam .... they get people probably just Bc of the name of the place. You would think you are getting wholesome good food. I mean if you can't serve a fresh fruit cup , how good can the rest of food be. My husband tried the chicken and waffles- the chicken was the frozen chicken tenders kind... and waffles looked like the frozen type too, my husband thinks the waffles aren't even made in the house. Also the worse tasting French press coffee I have ever had was at this place as well. Awful!!! Stay away..."

Updated review",1.0,"Argh. I decided to give FF another try--this time for a business lunch. The service was terrible and the food was mediocre. First, we had a 12:45 reservation and our full party arrived on time, but we still had to wait 15 minutes for a table in the crowded entryway, with people pushing by and bumping into our bags. It was so loud we could not carry on a conversation. Then we were seated, but the table wasn't clean, there was a menu jammed in the seat cushions, and our server struggled to identify the vegan items on the menu. He finally did locate a small menu that indicated which items are vegan and which could be modified to be vegan, but it was out of date. And then there was the wait for the food! We finally got it at 1:45, a full hour into our reservation. One of my colleagues had ordered pickles, which she asked to be brought out first, but she got them after all the entrees were served.All in all, an unpleasant experience. It befuddles me why this restaurant continues to be popular."

Updated review",4.0,"okay, I'm amending my previous 3-rating to a solid 4.  I still stand by my original review on brunch, which is just not worth the hype (my brunch standards: they are high), but after having dined here for dinner now twice more, Found Farmers is moving up in my Yelp world (they're sighing with relief, I'm sure). On our most recent visit, the reservation was a few minutes behind, but not too bad, and it was an excuse to order a gin cocktail that was out of this world at the bar.   Our party was a gaggle of us 8 strong.  Re: the dining: our waitress has the patience of Job.  The food this round was out of this world.  Vegetarian options aren't overwhelming, but they are plentiful (vegans... good luck). And maybe I had too much wine (and maybe I didn't--you don't know me), but all-in-all it was a much lovelier experience than before where I felt it lived up to the hype. But seriously: do not come here without a reservation.  That's not a thing."
Alesia C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",6/4/2016,4.0,"** make a reservation **!!!My family and I were visiting D.C. and heard about this popular breakfast/ brunch place! We made a reservation, and thank goodness we did because when we arrived around 10 AM, the wait time was quoted to be about an hour. The restaurant is two floors, didn't get a good look of the downstairs area, but the upstairs dining area was nice! It's a little dark for a breakfast place, a lot of people, so it was pretty loud inside. We ordered the Veggie Scramble, the Sausage, Mushroom, and Spinach Scramble, the Founding Farmers Breakfast, and the Pastrami Poached Egg Scramble.Veggie Scramble - got ciabatta and grits as a side: Delicious! This is the plate I ordered, originally wanted the Sausage scramble, but my sister got it, so decided to get something different and the veggie also sounded good. It was loaded with veggies, and they were all cooked well - nothing was over or underdone! I believe the scramble was made with egg whites instead of whole eggs, so ask to switch if you'd like! The grits were a lot thicker and chunkier than I thought they were going to be, reminded me more of oatmeal than actual grits - wouldn't recommend. The ciabatta was amazing - disappointed I got the smallest piece out of the table!Sausage, Mushroom, and Spinach Scramble - got ciabatta and leek hash browns as a sidePastrami Poached Egg Scramble - got ciabatta, doesn't come w/ a sideFounding Famers Breakfast - got eggs scrambled, bacon, ciabatta, and fruit as a sideOnly took bites out of the rest of the plates, but they were all delicious! The Pastrami Scramble would probably be the best of the four. The poached eggs were perfect, and it all came together really nicely. The portions did look a little small when the plates first arrived, but after eating, I think it was a good amount! The service was subpar... maybe it was cause we were from out of town, but our server barely checked up on us! Anyways, not a bad place to grab breakfast, definitely is popular, so make sure to prepare for a wait if you don't make that reservation!"
Sunny K.,"Chicago, IL",6/13/2016,4.0,"As the ladies next to me described this place: ""It's like Applebee's but, for like, hipsters...""Thank goodness I had a reservation, the waits can be horrendously long (up to an hour) even during dinner time!Cornbread ($5) - wow this was really really good right when it came on the table, it literally melt in my mouth! Paired with the sea salt butter and honey, it was downright heaven in my mouth! As it cools down, the corn kernals get annoying to eat so try to finish it while it's hot!Fried green tomatoes ($8) - meh; the real stand out is the cilantro green sauce and the cheese white sauceYankee Pot roast ($16) - this was nice and flavorful with a bed of roasted veggies and mashed potatoes; I wish there were more vegetables and less potatoes but the flavors were there + a sprig of rosemary too!Service was pretty slow but it's worth the reservations! Next time I'm getting the corn bread again :)"
Tracy D.,"Seattle, WA",6/28/2016,5.0,"This farm to table place is great. I can see why it gets filled up so easily and a reservation is needed unless you want to wait forever. Great service! So nice and efficient. All the food tasted great, and I love how big the tables are. The oversized furniture makes me feel small while I inhale whatever deliciousness is in front of me. My favorite thing is probably all the bacon they have. I LOVE BACON. Get some bacon drenched in some Texas BBQ sauce and have a little party in your belly. I'm from Texas, so that means something when I love their BBQ sauce.You should also get the beignets. Little bits of fried heaven accompanied by three different dipping sauces? YES PLEASE."
Allie M.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",8/23/2017,5.0,"This is a really great weekend brunch spot, but it does get crowded and loud if you are there during peak hours. However, they have the best chicken and waffles in the city!!"
Tara B.,"San Jose, CA",6/10/2017,4.0,"Great vegetable scrabble! This scramble had turnips, broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, and other yummy local vegetables that made this the best scrabble ever! The hash browns had leaks in them. Can you say, yummy""? Healthy food options galore! They even serve salad as a side for breakfast. Oh, the orange juice is fresh squeezed without any additives. Love this healthy options place!"
Bailey T.,"Houston, TX",6/8/2016,4.0,"**Get a reservation first and save yourself a 2 hour wait for brunch.**I've been in DC little over a week and I've already been here twice lol. My friends and I joke that this is the staple DC restaurant - you have to come here at least once, and if someone is visiting you, you have to take them here for at least one meal. While Founding Farmers isn't the absolute best brunch I've ever had, it's reliably good, has a great farm-to-table menu, and is just a fun trendy place to go on a weekend morning. I haven't been for any meal other than brunch, but my friends say that any time of day you are sure to have a great experience.The item to get here is the beneigts. They are warm, fresh, covered in delicious powdered sugar and tbh even better than the ones I've had in New Orleans. They come with a trio of sauces, so when you smother that beneigt in chocolate, strawberry, and caramel, you will be lost in decadence and forget about all the time you may have spent waiting for your table.I love their eggs benedict. It's only $10, a great cost for a brunch dish that's typically on the pricier side, and it's absolutely delicious. But honestly you can't go wrong here whatever you order - after one visit you will see why it's the hottest brunch spot in DC!"
Henry F.,"Baltimore, MD",1/23/2017,4.0,"MAKE RESERVATIONS!! Came here for Brunch and was amazed at how many people were waiting so make sure to book a reservation if you plan on going. Honestly I'm not a huge brunch guy (I know..) but being one of the most popular spots in DC I had to try it out and I'm happy I did! Got the chicken and waffles, beignets to share and tried the french toast. Everything was great! Beignets were warm and crispy but fluffy at the same time. Came with good dipping sauces and I couldnt stop eating them. The chicken and waffles were very well made, juicy chicken and nice waffle and the french toast was also addicting. Overall, if you're looking for Brunch this is a wonderful place... if you make reservations"
Alyssa C.,"Davie, FL",5/3/2017,4.0,"The best stuffed French toast ever! All local and delicious food, best place for breakfast!! Really enjoyed this place!"
Logan L.,"Arlington, TX",7/4/2017,5.0,Loved the food!! Great flavors and sauces incorporated into these recipes. I recommend the prime rib and carrot cake for dessert. You must reserve to get seating in a reasonable amount of time. Waiters and staff are very hospitable and polite.
Virginia C.,"Saint Louis, MO",7/7/2016,4.0,Love this place but it is super busy for brunch. Like 2 hour wait busy. So I suggest coming earlier than 10am to beat the rush or get reservationsPros:1) Chicken and Waffles2) Beignets3) Service was excellent and I always had drinks and water4) Any egg dishCons1) Just the wait but they do have an upstairs. If your in the area- this is the place to go.
Robert F.,"Kensington, MD",8/22/2017,4.0,"Great place to meet for a drink, bar area is somewhat loud, dining is less loud. Food, and drinks are outstanding, and the atmosphere is pleasant."
Thomas C.,"Aiea, HI",9/5/2017,5.0,We had the rib eye and the pork chop for dinner and both were excellent.  Make sure you have reservations as it gets busy.  There was a line when we walked by at breakfast and when we went in for dinner.
Mary-Lauren S.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/5/2016,4.0,"Definitely make a reservation because there will always be a crowd! Their menu is extensive and is perfect for an easy meal in the city. The prices are reasonable, the portions are large and the service is great considering they are always packed. If you typically go for Ahi Tuna Salads, give theirs a try. It is outstanding! My friend got the rotisserie chicken and it was massive. Could easily feed two."
Janelle E.,"Centreville, VA",11/29/2016,5.0,"Can I give this place 10 stars?  I'm so anxious to go back and eventually try everything.  Friends of ours brought us here on a Friday night.  I hear it's recommended to have a reservation.  We didn't have a reservation but we only waited about 20 minutes.  I hear the wait can be much longer though so I plan on making a reservation next time, just in case.  Since it was our first time the server explained that their food is sustainable.  Now I can't remember the details on what that means exactly but it was all good stuff! Lol.  Let's just get into the taste of the food shall we?  I ordered the pot roast, which is one of their signature dishes.  The meat was melt-your-mouth good!  The vegetables that came in the gravy was equally proportion to the meat.  The serving was so big that I had enough for a full meal of leftovers the next day.  I also ordered a chocolate egg cream!  Delicious, as well.  I thought that ordering cornbread to go alongside with my pot roast it sounded like a good idea.  Since the cornbread is considered an appetizer it came out first.  The cornbread never made it to be eaten alongside the pot roast because it was devoured in a few minutes.  The butter that they whip and drizzle with honey is heavenly.  I highly recommend the cornbread even if you don't like cornbread!When in downtown DC, founding farmers is the way to go!  The restaurant is beautiful, Service is great, prices are fair, and the food is absolutely delicious.  You won't be disappointed!"
Pauline P.,"Plano, TX",5/31/2016,3.0,"Founding Farmers claims to be ""farm to table"" and make everything in house from scratch. The trend that seems to be sweeping the nation is this ""farm to table"" mantra that up and coming restaurants are practicing themselves, which is great. Founding Farmers seems to be one of the most popular and highly rated restaurants in DC so I strongly recommend making a reservation or you'll have to wait for awhile like I did. They put their own spin on All-American classics and have a wide range of items on the menu.We ordered the spicy sausage pei mussels to start off with and thought they were amazing. I was literally using the mussel shells to drink the sauce it was cooked in. Very delicious and so fresh. Since the appetizer was so good, I could not wait for my main entree and had high expectations.For my main entree, I went with the seafood bucatini. The lobster, shrimp and mussels it came with were cooked perfectly, seasoned relatively well, and definitely tasted fresh. However, when it came to the pasta I felt like I was eating straight up boiled pasta. There was barely any flavor in the noodles. The sauce is very watery so when combined with the thick bucatini - the bucatini does not absorb much (if any) flavor. Also, the pieces of bread it came with were burnt. Sadly, the seafood bucatini was a very mediocre dish that I had to amp up with Tabasco sauce. I tried my sister's lobster mac and cheese (which was more like lobster rigatoni) and thought it was alright, a bit heavy on the bread crumbs...for $28 it was not all that. I did not get a chance to try the chicken and waffles but it seemed to be a hit since my brother ate the entire dish.I did enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant albeit it was a bit loud and thought the service was great. Overall a decent dining experience."
Alison F.,"Addison, TX",8/15/2017,5.0,"Amazing & well worth the wait! We dropped in with no reservation & were able to snag a spot at the bar within 15 minutes of waiting. We decided just to eat there since the wait for a table was about an hour. Bartender was super nice & made some yummy cocktails! I had the Cucumber Delight and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had, not too sweet with just the perfect amount of kick! We ordered the burger, fried chicken salad & chicken pot pie and each were superb."
Clarissa J.,"Jacksonville, NC",8/15/2017,5.0,I heard a lot about this place decided to try it for lunch one day and it was great best lunch I have had in a while that was worth the price. This place is a must try if your in the area.
Luis G.,"Philadelphia, PA",8/8/2017,3.0,"Visiting DC for the day and our first stop...the always crowded Founding Farmers.  We actually came for breakfast but missed the cutoff time of 2pm and instead had to settle for lunch.  This is my 2nd time here and I'm glad we made a reservation.  The wait for walk ins was about an hour and half.  Anyway, getting to the food review...ehem...I ordered the Farmers Slaw Reuben sandwich with a side of the 7-cheese mac and cheese.  The waitress informed me that everything served is locally sourced and made from scratch...from the meats to the bread to the pasta to veggies.  The reuben sandwich featured pastrami brisket, housemade coleslaw on multi grain bread.  The pastrami was very tasty but light on the portion.  The coleslaw was not too sweet but added a creamy texture to the sandwich's inside.  The bread was hearty but not too dense.  Overall, the Farmers slaw reuben was good however the sandwich could of been a little bigger at the price point of $14.  Next, the mac and cheese, which was served on the same plate as the sandwich.   I would have rather had the mac and cheese in a separate small bowl, especially since the cheese was not as gooey as I'd expected in a 7-cheese mac and cheese.  The cheese was very runny and had a slightly thicker than milk like consistency which infiltrated the bread of my sandwich making it a bit soggy.  The waitress explained that the runny consistency was due in part to there being no additives binding the cheese...whatever.  I like my mac and cheese gooey I don't know about you.  To wash down my meal, I had the passion fruit phosphate which is a housemade soda.  It was tart, fizzy and was ok...wasn't a big fan.  On another note, my partner's sautéed spinach was cook perfectly and had a nice garlicy taste...it was the star of the meal.  Her turkey, gruyere and honey mustard sandwich was juicy, flavorful and served in a hearty ciabatta bread.  Overall, Founding Farmers is an average, pricey, out of towner attraction."
Richard J.,"The Woodlands, TX",7/14/2016,5.0,"5pm reservation and this place was rockin! Nice hostess, even though they were very busy. They are very systematic in how they call you for your table. Minimal wait past our reservation time. We had the Devil-ish eggs for a starter. They were good, but not Wow-wee good. Lacked a little on the deviled egg aspect, mostly the egg white. The entrees were delish, I had the fried chicken salad. Comes with tomatoes, avocado, onion and 3 types of dressing. Chicken tastes like it was fresh off the grill. I could eat this every day!  My wife had the Shrimp Bucatini. The shrimp were tender and deliciously seasoned. Rosemarie was our server and did a wonderful job. Very friendly, smiled and came back to the table several times to follow up with us after we received our meals. She was great!!!We loved this place, and will be back before the end of our vacation. Y'all need to build a Founding Farmers in Houston."
CM C.,"San Diego, CA",3/11/2017,5.0,"Easily my favorite restaurant in DC.  I order something different every time and they never disappoint. This time I had the short rib with sweet potato and green beans.  We started off with the corn bread between two of us. We only finished half of it combined because it was filling and as much as we wanted to commit to the whole thing at first sight, we had to save ourselves for our entrees (and marriage).The short rib was so tender it melts in your mouth and makes me wanna shout..and apparently rap. Beignets were dessert. Soooo I thought I was going to be disappointed because I'm a cafe du monde (in New Orleans) fiend and thought nothing would ever compare but these were amazing. Soft crunch on the outside, gooey on the inside...powder my life.Oh! And our server was great. He even told us a joke that I will never forget.. ""How does Harry Potter go down a hill?"" ........ ""Walking. JK rolling(Rowling)"" bahhahaha ok enjoy!"
Jen C.,"Jersey City, NJ",7/12/2016,4.0,"This place is worth the hype.  Need to make reservations in advance but you can double check day of and may get lucky because I did. Minus one star because even with reservations we had to wait another 30 minutes so be prepared to wait wait wait.The vibe is great, everyone is really nice, not super pretentious like in NYC. Great for large groups they have long tables and a couple of large round tables that could fit 6 ppl. Everything is reasonably priced, not like NYC. Farm to table and freshly fermented liquor. The drinks are excellent and I agree with my friends that it makes your experience that much better. I had a bourbon drink and it was really tasty, not the strongest but very flavorful, a little to much ice. My friend had their tequila special and also flavorful, but a lot of ice. Drinks are $12Apps:$9 Brie bread- absolutely delicious. Fresh apple, warm Brie, crispy bread with caramelized marmalade $9 fried green tomatoes- very well made. Crispy skin. Firm tomato, great dips.Entree: scallop butternut risotto $24So good! Perfect portion size. You get 4 Very juicy scallops, perfectly cooked (seared nicely and tender on the inside)   The risotto was also very nicely cooked, creamy yet has good consistency with a light butternut to flavor.Friend had the charred Atlantic fish which means salmon apparently. Not that great. Also had the mushroom gnocchi- didn't try it but friend thought it was very tasty.I will be back for sure!"
Brian L.,"New Hyde Park, NY",1/10/2017,5.0,"I love and adore this place! Come here for branch. Their branch is just good. You can get their pancakes, chicken& waffle. The chicken is boneless so that's fantastic! I been here for dinner and lunch as well but every time I come here there are new additions or slight tweak to the menu. But overall it has a reasonable priced items for students to enjoy. With no appetizer you can get a fulfilling meal under $20 for dinner or lunch. For brunch under $15."
Laurisha C.,"San Francisco, CA",1/10/2017,3.0,"Overrated. I find the staff to be aloof and rarely check on patrons, or they do it's to get you to leave. Founding was one of the original farm to table restaurants in DC, but with many new vendors realizing the need to create more healthy options, Founding will need to start valuing their customers before they leave. If you go for brunch, get their Compass French Press it's divine! I say all of this and then have to admit that their cocktails are the best in the city. Le sigh."
Unique W.,"Washington, DC",5/14/2017,3.0,"I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was amazing. The waffles were a little under cooked and the eggs were watery. Also when I asked them to add cheese into the eggs ; it appears they put the cheese on top of the eggs instead of mixing it into the eggs. There is little to no parking available and if it is , you have to pay a meter. You can sit down and eat and they also have a bar. The best thing was the chicken and it was great. I can tell the marinate the meat unto the batter and then they cook it. I would definitely come back for the chicken tenders alone."
Karey M.,"Boise, ID",7/30/2017,5.0,"Came here for brunch and had a brief wait...but it was well worth it. They make their own ginger beer in house, which made their Dark-n-Stormy one of the best I've ever had. Had the bacon wrapped blue cheese figs, and brie flat bread to start. They were both delicious! We split the Reuben and it was perfectly balanced. Atmosphere and staff were great. Worth the wait!"
Nicole P.,"Sneads Ferry, NC",9/4/2017,5.0,"Not that founding farmers needs anymore help here on Yelp, but for those who are thinking about coming and aren't sure, trust your instincts! Also, yes, MAKE A RESERVATION. We had a reservation for our party of 5 and arrived just a few moments before our lunch time @1:15. We were seated within the first five minutes while others were waiting almost two hours! I ordered the chicken pot pie and it was delicious. My husband had the meatloaf and he loved it. My mother in law (vegetarian) ordered the grilled cheese, tomato soup, and the pickled potato salad which was so delicious. My father in law was happy with his chicken and waffles. Overall, it was a great experience! For four adults and one five year old, plus one appetizer, one fresh squeezed juice, and two beers, our total was about 120. We all felt it was worth the price and were expecting it to be more. I hate spending money on eating out as I rarely feel that it is worth it, but I think with the food + our positive experience it was worth it. MAKE A RESERVATION. Lol"
Erin-marie P D.,"Manhattan, NY",6/30/2017,4.0,"Went at 7 AM (went to Lincoln memorial before) and there weren't that many people there. My group and I ordered beignets, the founding farmers breakfast, crab Benedicts and banana foster french toast. Starting with the beignets, they were very light and not really substantial than what I was expecting. The crab Benedict was a little salty and it had this cheddar taste for some reason even though the menu didn't mention cheese. In addition the English muffin was hard to cut, like you really had to put effort for each bite. The banana foster french toast was probably in my opinion a mistake to order. The banana was not really noticeable and the creme inside was heavy and not sweet. Overall, service was fantastic, but food is decent"
Sarah H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/6/2016,4.0,"This place is great - farm to table yumminess. The brunch is awesome - corn bread, waffles, everything is great! The staff is friendly and relatively quick. The only downfall is that the wait is always insane (even with a reservation) and it's loud and always so so full of people. You feel like you're eating with the table next to you. Nonetheless, this place is still awesome and everyone should check it out for drinks / brunch / dinner at least once! The one in Tysons Corner is also very nice!"
Anthony B.,"Dallas, TX",12/8/2016,5.0,"Surprised that I don't already have a review of this place. Got to go here a few years ago and it exceeded my expectations. Happy to say that after a few years, it is still a great place to eat.All the food here is stellar and for reasonable prices. While we waited for our table, we grabbed some drinks at the crowded bar. While crowded, the bar staff is very attentive.  They understand how packed the bar area is, but I could tell they were constantly checking around to make sure everyone was tended to. We were able to get our drinks without struggle and they tasted great.As far as dinner goes, everything was top notch. We ordered a few appetizers- cornbread, fried green tomatoes, and the bacon lollis. May have been a bit much for two people haha. The cornbread comes out in a skillet and tastes fantastic. Whole sweet corn chunks are found within and the bread is super moist.  The tomatoes are very fresh and the breading has great flavor with a little bit of spice- very tasty.  The bacon lollis are really good as well, the caramelization isn't overbearing- my only wish was that the slices were a little thicker, but I'm just being picky.Main course- friend had the salmon and I had the scallops with risotto. Friend enjoyed the salmon and the scallops were great. The scallops were a decent size and they were cooked well- not rubbery, good sear- a nice sweet flavor. The risotto was creamy and had tons of flavor.  Dessert- had the beignets. Man, fried dough and powdered sugar is amazing. That's all I have to say.All in all, great place to eat, really great bang for your buck. I hope it doesn't take me years to come back again!"
Rima F.,"New York, NY",12/8/2016,2.0,"Entering this place was like a nightmare in noise and crowding. I wanted to leave right away but alas I was expecting a friend for our reservation and there is no other place in the immediate area to eat.  Such is the desert that is downtown DC at night.Luckily, we got a quiet table near the bathroom upstairs. The food quality was only just OK and my friend was quite dissatisfied with her shrimp and grits because there were almost no grits but lots of onions. The wine wound up giving me a bad headache later on which only happens to me with inexpensive wine (although my glass cost $12) We were clearly not eating or finishing-up fast enough, because a parade of personnel came through ever so often to remove a glass or a bowl. We even received an extra check from some unknown person right after ordering our last thing. It was almost like being in a Chinese restaurant where the staff is often brusque to move you out.So in summary, this place is great for people who enjoy crowding, very loud noise, not having to talk with their friends,and want a quick meal after work so they can get back on the road for their long commutes to  Woodbridge or Annandale."
Bobo F.,"Brooklyn, NY",6/29/2017,3.0,"The people who work here couldn't be sweeter. And I adore the fact that they have sustainable/happy meat and fresh produce. But almost everything we ordered was bland. I don't really get why it's so busy there... I'd skip it for now. If their executive chef starts paying a little closer attention to what's coming out of the kitchen, it could get interesting."
Christina D.,"Orlando, FL",1/3/2017,5.0,"I came here for brunch after a tip off that this is the place to be in DC. First of all, I want to give a whole separate 5 stars to their cocktail menu. Their Bloody Mary is BOMB. If you like a spicy Bloody Mary in the morning, absolutely give this the one at Founding Farmers a try. If you're a gin lover and love creamy drinks ... and are open to combining these two loves, try the gin fizz! It is one of my favorite cocktails ever. The creaminess of the egg cream perfectly complements the bitterness of the gin. Now for food... the chicken and waffles are delicious, I absolutely recommend . The waffles are different from what I'm used to (I'm a northerner and we like our waffles as crispy as a fall leaf) . The waffle here is soft and fluffier than my pillow at home. For my side,I got the tripled whipped red potatoes which is one of the creamiest mashed potatoes I've ever eaten. We also ordered the cornbread in a skillet. It's not as gritty as the bread I'm used to but it's packed with real whole kernels of corn which gave it a very sweet flavor. Served with a tin of whipped butter and honey... mm mm yum! The wait here during lunch time is excruciating. I called at 10:30am and managed to get a 1:30 pm reservation . And thank goodness I did, the restaurant was PACKED. I'll say it again: get a reservation! But at the end of the day, if you're in DC and want a quintessential dc brunch, definitely try to get a spot at Founding Farmers, it's worth it."
Bianca M.,"Philadelphia, PA",5/31/2017,4.0,"Went there for Brunch on Memorial Day and the place is amazing! The food was quick and best of all they accept reservations which is great since it seems its such a popular spot. We ordered the cornbread for the table, i got a stack of the red velvet pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon and my friend ordered the chicken and waffles. The pancakes were super fluffy, the scrambled eggs super creamy and the thick bacon was just perfect. The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is for two reasons: 1) while the chicken was seasoned tl perfection the portion of it vs the size of the waffle was off. Very small portion. And everyone knows that the best meat for this dish is dark meat and they used white meat. 2) the red velvet pancakes need like a cream cheese glaze or something to male them really pop. That would take the dish to perfection."
Trent A.,"Raleigh, NC",11/19/2016,4.0,"Brunch is my favorite meal. I could eat brunch for every meal in fact. I've eaten brunch in NY, LA, Vegas and many more cities. So when I say this is as good a brunch as I have had anywhere else, I'm camparing against some very stiff competition. The beignets and stuffed French toast were exceptional!I do recommend making reservations ahead of time if possible. In our case we had no reservations so we had to put ourselves on the wait list. Happily the White House is a short walk away, something we took advantage of to help pass the time."
Lily Y.,"Merritt Island, FL",11/29/2016,4.0,"Got together with friends and had dinner here. I haven't been to Founding Farmers since moving from the DC Metro area a few years ago and I remembered it as having great food and great service. This visit, food was good; but service was only okay. I suppose it could have been because of the Thanksgiving weekend crush..."
Lori M.,"Chicago, IL",5/5/2017,4.0,"YUM! I love this place. The leek hashbrowns are to die for. I've been a few times, but the last visit it what inspired me to write a review.I like to order poached eggs with my breakfast and it is very rare that they are ever poached properly. I don't like to complain because i know that it's difficult to poach an egg properly, especially if it's busy. My last visit to FFDC was a treat because the server recognized that my eggs were overdone immediately after i cut into one of them. She promptly returned with eggs that were properly poached. This may not seem like a big deal to everyone, but it made my day. I love to see people who are great at what they do and FF is great at what they do. Delicious food, excellent servers, delightful meal."
Liza M.,"Washington, DC",12/31/2016,3.0,"I came here in 2011 and then again in 2015. The first time we came with a large party so we had a huge table and the food was good. The second time, we came by for brunch during a blizzard. It was fine, the service was a bit slow and the food didn't seem memorable. The food is basic American food - its a really popular spot, but I'm honestly not quite sure. I think it might be because there are so many students in the area with GW and Georgetown undergrad so close. We haven't been back since early last year and it doesn't really stand out anymore as it did a good few years ago. If you want to try it then go for it but I wouldn't suggest going out of your way or waiting in line at all since there are a lot of really good places in the area and in DC in general that are actually worth the wait or the trek. I don't think Founding Farmers is living up to their hype and it might be because they've turned into a chain... not sure."
F H.,"Sacramento, CA",6/7/2017,5.0,"A friend of ours from CA suggested that we visit Founding Farmers and we were not disappointed. We made a reservation, which is something all people should do to ensure little to no wait. Service was also great. Drinks were delicious, especially on a hot day. The appetizers were amazing - cornbread and spicy crab dip. Also, all of our dishes were fantastic. People who visit DC should plan at least one meal here."
Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",12/17/2016,5.0,"Great location! Only half a mile from the White House! We came on a Saturday evening and it was busy. We waited for an hour and were taking upstairs. Our waitress was very nice, explained her restaurant's specialties and promptly took out order. I had the meatloaf with a side of fries and green beans. The meatloaf was well done but seasoned to perfection. The red mashed were awesomely creamy and delicious. My girl has the grilled cheese and said it was the best she's had. She also enjoyed her sides of fries and the tomato soup. My nephew wanted pasta with marinara. They didn't have this on their menu but our server was kind enough to get the cool to make an order. 5 stars for food and service!"
Kelly N.,"Washington, DC",8/20/2017,4.0,"I enjoy Founding Farmers and I find it a crowd pleaser when you have a large group, especially with kids. They recently changed their chicken pot pie recipe, much to my dismay, but other highlights on the menu are their craft cocktails and cornbread. I'd definitely make a reservation well in advance as it tends to book up fast!"
Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",11/5/2016,4.0,"Was skeptical about this place given it's still just breakfast but we were pleasantly surprised.  Apparently everything is locally sourced/grown from the North Dakota farmer's union.RESERVATIONS: I made reservations about 2 weeks in advance for a Saturday morning at 11 and I'm glad we did. The place was packed and for a group of 2 probably would take about 45 min.  We got seated almost immediately.ATMOSPHERE: The downstairs has more of a casual/bar type feel with an actual bar in the middle.  The upstairs is more sit down and formal feeling.FOOD: I wanted to try the fried chicken and waffles but wasn't in the mood for fried chicken so instead I just got the maple cinnamon waffle and my husband got the farmer's breakfast.MAPLE CINNAMON WAFFLE - literally a plain waffle but you get to use their homemade maple cinnamon syrup which is already on the table.  At $6 it's not bad, but it's not super filly.  Their waffles are crispy and light, not super bready, doughy or dense.  I liked it a lot but it did get soggy quickly.FARMER'S BREAKFAST - comes with your choice of meat (can upgrade to thicker bacon for $3), eggs, and a side choice (hash browns, fruit...) and choice of bread.We got the upgraded pepper maple bacon and with 2 slices it's very thick where you have to cut it with a knife. I think it's worth it because of the fat content, the flavor, the juiciness and slight crisp on the edges.The leek hash browns were also very good, subtle leek flavor but the crispiness of the hashed browns on top were perfect.The buttered ciabatta was OK it was kinda dry/stale in the middle and not very toasted.Overall, I would recommend coming here for breakfast as they have a very extensive menu and you can taste the freshness of their ingredients."
Ronald S.,"Houston, TX",6/18/2017,5.0,"Found this amazing gem walking around with a party of 7. We walked in and they seated us right away on a Friday. Our waitress, Jess, was a fantastic waitress. We started off with the cornbread, must have. We got the crisps, chips as well, chips were pretty good with the dips. We all got a variety of food items. I got the cedar plank salmon, it was the best salmon I've had in awhile. Others got the prime rib and ravioli. They were all to die for. We topped it off with a red velvet cake. Definitely a place to try out with over 8k reviews and holding strong at 4/5 stars."
Chris B.,"Hedgesville, WV",8/16/2017,5.0,"Founding Farmers was amazing! Great atmosphere, and even better food. Definitely recommend! Only con was there is a fairly long wait so get there early."
Brittany J.,"Oak Park, IL",7/29/2017,3.0,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday and there was a wait, but we made reservations so it wasn't that long. Overall my experience was alright. The waiter raved about the chicken and waffles so I ordered them, but they were just mediocre. I also got the strawberry fizz drink (should've been stronger.) In my opinion stick to what you know aka the basics if ordering brunch."
Brittney N.,"Douglasville, GA",11/12/2016,5.0,"This place was pretty amazing!! We went there twice while I'm D.C. over the course of 3 days. The wait was over 45 minutes both times but the food came out so quickly that it made up for the long wait time. The first time we went here was for lunch, we had the skillet corn bread for an app and I had the chicken and waffles as my entree. It was wonderful! It was the best chicken and waffles I've had in a restaurant by far. The mac and cheese and green beans were also TBE! After having an amazing lunch at this place we came back again for brunch on my birthday. I had the stuff drenched toast and OMG, if I could fly back out to D.C. in the morning just to make brunch at this place I totally would! Great food, great experience, very impressed!"
The T.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",7/14/2017,2.0,"This place has great food but the service sucks!!! Unfortunately, when they are busy the service quality goes down."
LM B.,"San Diego, CA",6/17/2017,5.0,"Gosh, what else can be said about this place.  It really hits on all cylinders.  The best recommendation is get your reservation in early.  We had a variety of items-some appetizers, main courses, adult beverages and deserts. None disappointed. They food was served fast for as busy as the restaurant was and nothing was short changed.  Since bar is on main floor, one person in our party order rose. By time she got it unfortunately it was room temperature, not chilled.  Not a problem, got it taken care of immediately.  Very impressive."
Bobby M.,"West Chester, PA",5/1/2017,5.0,"wow can this place get any better?got the chicken and waffles and man, I don't think any place could top this. Waffles were light and buttery and to top it off, there is a homemade honey sauce drizzle that sealed the deal. On to the chicken, nicely flavored and skin is fried to a perfection. Mac and cheese and mash potatoes were just icing on top. This place is a must try!"
Mat L.,"San Francisco, CA",6/26/2017,4.0,"We dropped by for breakfast and enjoyed the ambience, food and service. It's obviously popular as we'd have had to wait for a table (Monday morning, 0930) but opted for a seat at the bar which is first come, first served. We kept it simple and had oatmeal + granola. Simple but yummy. Interesting menu and helpful staff. We had what seems to be a 'Washington thing' with our check i.e. an extra dish was on there which they quickly removed when asked. Third time in two days... (different restaurants). Overall - we'd go back and would recommend it."
Kelsey O.,"Bothell, WA",4/27/2017,4.0,"Great food and strong drinks. There's a reason this place is consistently popular. The location is super hip and the decor was modern yet rustic. As someone originally from the west coast, I decided to be brave and try some salmon on the east coast. (Yes, that's a big deal) I was more than pleasantly surprised with the ""simple style"" salmon. The salmon had a lovely crust and was moist on the inside. The carrots had a wonderful sweetness from the bourbon they were cooked in, both they and the green beans were still true vegetables with a light crunch instead of over cooked mush. My boyfriend got the lobster Mac and cheese, and fabulous doesn't even begin to describe it. All in all, we WILL be back."
Jerry C.,"Houston, TX",5/10/2016,5.0,"Prior to dining at Founding Farmers, I was in love with the concept of the restaurant; after dining at Founding Farmers, I was in love with the actual restaurant.A friend and I went for Sunday brunch with a reservation, and as every other review states, you'll want to come here with a reservation because it gets INSANELY busy. Is it worth waiting an hour for? I cringe at the idea of waiting that long to sit at a table when you know you can make reservations, but for Founding Farmers, I would consider it. Maybe.Anyway, we started off with the beignets - mistake! These were so freaking delicious that we were borderline full before our main plates came, so if you want the beignets, I suggest you get them as your dessert instead. But these are perfectly fried and ever-so-lightly dusted with powdered sugar with phenomenal dipping sauces (my favorite was the chocolate).For my entree, I got the beef pastrami poached egg hash - essentially eggs benedict atop a decadent hash in lieu of the English muffin (which is a choice for bread, but it's served on the side - I got the ciabatta instead). Just...really, really good. When you get the perfect bite of hash + egg, fireworks.Service is excellent, and the restaurant is a surprisingly affordable farm to table option (for brunch, at least). If I were a DC native, Founding Farmers would easily be at the top of my list for a random occasion to dine out."
Dee W.,"Houston, TX",8/15/2017,3.0,"I made reservations two months in advance based on rave reviews from foodie friends, good press and great reviews.  Love the concept, the menu sounded interesting and it's great for family-sized groups.  We were completely underwhelmed.  We enjoyed the crab cake and skillet cornbread most; the lobster Mac, meatloaf, squash ravioli and tomato soup dishes were average.  Disappointing overall."
Belen H.,"Oxnard, CA",1/18/2017,5.0,"One of the greatest affordable Eggs Benedict in the D.C. area! Good service, friendly staff and great food! Location is perfect for getting there by transit and walkable to many other nearby location.First visit to D.C. and been craving eggs Benedict but I know they can be expensive (I'm on that college budget right now) but this place has affordable eggs Benedict! Love! Would recommend! Timing may be tricky. I got there approx 8:30am on a Thursday. Seated within minutes. Single alone. Then 9am, packed and busy!"
Nina L.,"New York, NY",5/9/2016,5.0,"So glad I got the opportunity to dine here while visiting a friend in DC, it really is 5-star experience from all angles. Food, atmosphere, and service are all stellar from start to finish. We came with a large party (8), on reservation...this simple factoid is a blessing in itself as usually restaurants that have this good brunch service don't take reservations at all. We were seated and cared for with the utmost attention and the waitress was extremely knowledgable of the menu. Of all of the dishes our group ordered most notable was the fried chicken and waffles which was the best take on it I've ever had (even including the fantastic Pies N' Thighs of downtown Manhattan, NY). Something about their breading prep and chicken quality puts the product at out-of-bounds delicious. Also fantastic was the closing beignets which had the perfect consistency, and well-rounded flavor.Conclusively this a must when in DC. The pictures on Yelp don't do their dishes justice. Go found your own opinion about these farmers at your earliest convenience."
Keyanna M.,"Washington, DC",12/11/2016,4.0,"This is one of my favorite locations for breakfast. I'm in love with their grits! Yummers! I just wish that they had a kids menu. But like always, I shall return."
Meilani K.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/14/2016,5.0,"The food is great, the location and ambiance is wonderful, and the staff was friendly as well. I called in to make a reservation (my friend and I were visiting from out of town,) and we were able to get a lunch res at 1:30pm. We got their early and waited, and were seated at a communal table.We both got cocktails which were refreshing and strong, and the waitress helped us make some recommendations. Definitely get the bacon lollies. They are so tasty and make a great appetizer! It gets crowded, so definitely expect a wait or make a reservation. It was one of the most memorable places I ate while I visited DC!"
Ashley D.,"Ridgewood, NJ",11/12/2016,4.0,"Disclaimer: I went here just for the desserts so I can't rate any of the other foodOur waiter was friendly at first but got progressively less friendly as time went on. He eventually stopped attending to us for a period of time and we had to wait a while for the check, so that I did not like. Ambiance is very nice. Very pretty interior with a good noise level. I ordered the carrot cake and my boyfriend ordered the apple pie. For $9 you get a pretty massive piece of carrot cake. It was very yummy, just a little too much frosting. However, the ice cream helped balance it (ha). He loved his apple pie, which was also $9 and came with ice cream. I tried it and I loved the buttery crust. Very strong apple flavor as you'd expect! I'm not sure if I would come back but the woman next to us ordered a burger that looked pretty good."
Ida D.,"Evanston, IL",5/8/2016,3.0,"We came during our spring break trip to DC and thank god we made a reservation. We were seated right away and the waiter was very attentive.For starters, we ordered the cornbread, deviled eggs, and fried green tomatoes. The cornbread was probably the best I've ever had. On the other hand, the tomatoes and deviled eggs were just average. (Not sure what the hype about the green tomatoes is about)For entrees, we ordered the shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, and the pot roast. Nothing stood out except the waffles, which were extremely soft, moist, yet crunchy on the outside.Tips: order the cornbread and chicken & waffles."
Justin F.,"Howell, NJ",7/15/2017,4.0,"Terrific dinner, we had the catch of the day and rotisserie chicken. Best chicken skin since Kenny Rogers Roasters. Good cocktails, whiskey drinks ran a little sour and sweet but the Farmer Jon was very good. Service could have been a little more attentive. Would have tasted more of the bar."
Charlene Y.,"Lyon, France",7/30/2017,2.0,"Slightly disappointed to be honest. Given the hype and high ratings, I was expecting more. Came here for brunch and I ordered the beet and goat cheese hash with poached eggs, which was decent but not amazing. The eggs were overdone, but the flavors were okay. Honestly the entire experience was just lacking."

Updated review",5.0,"I went back to founding farmers with the friend right before she moved out of DC. It was a sad occasion for all, because not only was my friend leaving, but I also discovered the beignets at founding farmers on my possibly last visit to DC.... SAD-FACELet me start by saying that my only complaint is how busy this place was, I mean seriously, they MUST be doing something right, because people wait for HOURS. Luckily, I made reservations. We were seated right on time, but not earlier. We were immediately given menus and water, which I always like. I got the beignets (am I even spelling that right?) to share. We literally argued for 10 minutes over which of the 3 dipping sauces were better, they were all good, but I liked the berry one. I got a Pimm's Cup to drink and it featured fresh cucumber and was very refreshing. Then we ordered the roasted veg pan scramble and the beet and goat cheese bennie. The beet and goat cheese bennie wins hands down. The scrambler, was good, but it was on par with other breakfast places... That bennie, I have dreams about how good it was. So here is my sad story about how I discovered my favorite brunch place on the last time I got to visit my bestie in DC :("
Ann T.,"Fairfax, VA",4/28/2017,3.0,"Founding Farmers was one of my favorite restaurants in DC. It was one of the first ""farm-to-table"" experiences I had as a college student at GW. It brings back fond memories of late night drinks, great conversations, with a good atmosphere. I love going to Founding Farmers and would never turn down an opportunity to eat there.That being said, I have to downgrade Founding Farmers for the following - 1) two-one person uni-sex bathrooms. What a terrible idea for a restaurant that size2) service is slow. I'm talking REAL slow. Looking for our waiter slow. We even commented that we could have had two and half drinks by the time they brought out our first round of drinks and we're not a boozy kind of crowd to say the least. It was just that slow. 3) the chicken pot pie did not have a pastry filling in the bottom. I was really surprised. The top was deliciously crisp and flaky, but no bottom?! the BF felt cheated4) Always busy. Make a reservation.Some highlights?The flat bread is amazing. Try any one - they're bound to be good.The cornbread appetizer was delicious"
Khadija M.,"Charlotte, NC",6/13/2017,3.0,"Planned a farewell dinner for a friend moving to the west coast. Having been to Founding Farmers in the past, we expected a delicious meal and courteous staff. Instead, we got the opposite. With an 8:15 pm reservation, we were seated close to 8:30 (no big deal). After waiting for about twenty minutes, a different server (who was not our original waiter) came to check on us - we gave her our order due to the fact that our waiter had never reappeared. Nearly 25 minutes later, our food was brought out. Except, our original waiter brought out a poke bowl instead of the salad I ordered. On top of that, the plates had obviously been sitting under heating lamps for some time (congealed sauces and gravies). We also never received plates for our ordered appetizers - it was a mess all around. I eventually received my salad while the others in my party were wrapping up their meals. After waiting an hour for food our waiter then began to rush us. Standing over our table while we were obviously still eating and talking to one another. The last straw was when a friend ordered an americano and received a regular coffee. Needless to say, it was a less than average experience and we won't be back. Save your time and go to DC's other great restaurants!"
Dee B.,"Lubbock, TX",6/23/2017,5.0,Love this place! The food is wonderful. Breakfast is great among the bustling DC day and night. Breakfast is wonderful and crab egg benefit is lovely as well as the steak and eggs. Good coffee! Great friendly service. The only down side is the snobby male hostess that gives not such a warm greeting but push past that DC pretentiousness and you are in for a wonderful experience. Cocktails and wine list are great!

Updated review",2.0,"WHAT HAPPENED HERE???As my previous review stated, we used to dine here quite often (college and early post college days) and really enjoyed the food and everything from decor, staff and service. I haven't been here for awhile (maybe only two visits, the past 3 years), and it was never the same as how it used to be. But the experience this past Sunday really was the worst of it all.5 of us came here for my father in laws birthday dinner. Some of them got here extrely early, and the same policy of not sitting anyone until all party shows up still applies, no biggie. Everything was descent at the beginning. We ordered some drinks (scratch soda is still yummy, I got the pineapple lime), put in some appetizers, including fig prosciutto flat bread, fried green tomato and crab dip. Fried green tomatoe was crispy, hot and delicious, crab dip had a generous amount of crab in it as well as a piece of crab shell, flavor was good but it was very greasy, and the flat bread had its better days. For entrees, we ordered a few different things. I got spicy ahi poke. It wasn't an authentic Hawaiian poke, but it was refreshing and light for a warm day, and it definitely was spicy. My brother in law got fillet and crab cake. When the food was served, the steak was definitely not fillet, and there was no explaination from our server as why a piece of non-fillet was on the plate. We politely asked him what cut it was, he said he'd check, but ever came back with an answer after he was back on the floor. My brother in law finally had to wave him down to ask again, and it turned out they were out of fillet, so he got a butcher cut. The steak was ordered as medium rare, but it looked more like medium/medium well but was still good, according to my brother in law.Here comes the ""better"" part of the evening. My husband ordered a steak chili with a side of salad. The flavor was good, but it was mostly a bowl of steak and grizzle, which can be overwhelming and too meaty, depending on what kind of veggie/meat ratio people are looking for. As for the side salad, there was a piece of almond-looking thing on the plate, which later was confirmed as almond by the kitchen. First of all, why was almond never listed on the menu for this particular salad? Second, when we ordered our food, we specifically said that my husband and brother in law both had food allergy, especially to nuts. We later recalled that our server did not write any notes down when hearing about the allergy issues. It was ""good"" that the salad was for my husband, whose allergy was milder. If it were my brother in law, the evening would turn out terribly as one bite of nuts could send him to ER.The manager came out and sincerely apologized. When we got the check, we were told that all food was comped. We really appreciate the gesture, though it was really not necessary. With that being said, I can't give this place more than 2 stars. The food being not of old-time standard was one thing, but the staff training seems to be severely lacking. Our server was very careless and had no sense of urgency in any matters whatsoever, and the evening wasn't busier than any other evening here.This place needs to get itself together, with so many expansions the past a few years while not being able to keep its standard and elements that used to make this place standout, it seems to lose its appeal and is turning into a Cheesecake Factory..."
Sheila O.,"San Rafael, CA",5/2/2017,5.0,Oh My! What a great find! You have to try it and its worth the wait! It always has a line out the door for a reason--Its Worth It! We had to wait maybe 10 minutes for our seats which were at a table joined by a few others! We started off with Corn Bread--to die for! It is served in a pan and its home baked served hot with melting butter! We could only eat half--too much! ThenI ordered Broiled  Chicken and my husband had Meatloaf! The Chicken was out of this world! It was all white meat and again could not eat it all! The potatoes were awesome and the green beans also! My husband said the Meatloaf was great and so moist it crumbled as you ate it! I don't think you can go wrong in this place! We can't wait to go back and try their breakfast! Our waitress was so nice and service was excellent! A great find and we will be back! Its worth the wait!
Joey R.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/24/2016,2.0,"Although this place has 4 stars with 7,600 reviews, I was pretty disappointed at the service and quality of the food. Thank lord I reserved before hand, I got a table at the time I reserved although I arrived early, the place was super packed. It was cute that they have a mini bookshelf with books for children and adults to read however the books were old and ripped. The waiting area was small so people were forced to wait outside. When seated, there were no server until a while later. I got the blue cheese balsamic bacon burger. It was average, I had better, but the value for the burger was decent. We also got the signature steak and the steak was burnt! We had it medium, it was definitely well done and burnt. We couldn't rip the burnt pieces out either because it was stuck onto the meat. The steak was really small and thin, not worth it's value. Another thing, I read the reviews about the dirty glasses. Our waiter came with the glasses and it was really dirty, I didn't even want to touch it or drink from it. So I ordered hot water. The cups were filled with coffee stains!! I was really disappointed with everything. I think it's about time for them to change a whole new set of cups and glasses. Everything is really old and disgusting. Wouldn't recommend this place. Definitely overrated."
A S.,"Springfield, VA",9/3/2017,5.0,"Wait times are up to 1.5hr but the wait was well worth it. The food was amazing. The atmosphere is nice. This would be a perfect spot for brunch with girls (which is what we did today) or for a date. Meals are pricey but they give you a lot for what you pay for. Although, I'm totally fine with smaller food portions."
Shelby C.,"San Diego, CA",8/12/2017,5.0,"My friend and I stopped here on a whim and it was delicious to say the least. I had the alcoholic drink the constitution. They don't skimo on the alcohol like others. Then I had the shrimp and grits that also included sausage. Great food, would go back!"
Jay H.,"Roanoke, VA",9/6/2017,5.0,This place just does everything well. Expertly crafted drinks and high end comfort food. Simply my favorite place in the District. Only negative is it's hard to get in because it's so popular. That and I am usually miserable from eating too damn much.
Julie D.,"Manhattan, NY",5/14/2017,3.0,"We had heard a lot about this place from various people. Breakfast reservations were easy to get via OpenTable and we had no problem getting seated. The food, however, was just okay. The menu was basic with nothing really sticking out as special. For as awesome as this place sounded, it seems they should have original or really great items on the menu. I tried the Hangover Hash in an effort to get something off the beaten path and it was good. I also got blueberry pancakes though and they were meh. The syrup was also not great and was watery. Perhaps I've been spoiled by great pancake options in NYC but it doesn't seem that hard to make awesome pancakes. The service was fine as was the place but again...nothing as special as I'd expected."
Amanda M.,"Vienna, VA",1/21/2017,3.0,"What I like about Founding Farmers is their use of high quality ingredients. I ended up getting a burger and fries, and it tasted homemade. Given that my dad makes really good burgers this is high praise. I would give this a higher rating but personally I find the menu a bit basic. That's not a bad thing inherently, and they do an amazing job of preparing their menu items, but it isn't up to my taste in terms of options. Perhaps I'll follow this up by taking a trip to Farmers Fishers Bakers..The setup of the restaurant itself seems to me to be a bit claustrophobic. We were sat at a two-top with people on either side of us, and we could hear their entire conversations. It also was a weeknight, but it got very crowded very early. If you end up going please make sure to make a reservation, and go with a group of people who arrive on time! Otherwise you'll be stuck waiting, and the front area gets very crowded as it is a popular restaurant."
Lucas W.,"Wilmette, IL",10/28/2016,5.0,"Founding Farmers was fantastic. All the food was great, creative, and well priced/portioned. My one warning: be prepared for a line and get a reservation.We started with both the cornbread and the bacon lollis. The conbread was great, the honey butter was delicious and the content of the bread was good, moist. Not the most creative cornbread I've had but we liked it.The bacon lollis on the other hand were totally unique and unbelievably good. I could've had nothing but bacon lollis. They're a little pricy for the volume of food you get, but incredible and so well worth it. These are a must try. The mixture of brown sugar, cinnamon, and whatever else they had in the rub on the bacon which was perfectly cooked and not greasy at all was unbelievable. The highlight of the meal for me. My girlfriend and I then split the chicken and waffles. These were great. I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken but I really liked this chicken. Again, like the bacon, not overly greasy and the chicken was both moist and cooked perfectly. I would definitely get it again. The waffles were tasty of course and the mac and cheese was pretty good as well.Overall, Founding Farmers was an excellent choice and I'd highly recommend it, though it is very busy."
Ronnie E.,"Miami, FL",12/12/2016,5.0,"The chicken and waffles are amazing!! Probably the best outside of ATL I have ever tasted. I got the breakfast version with scrambled eggs, and those eggs are probably the best scrambled eggs in the US of A. The waffle was so light and crispy, I'm still thinking about it 3 days later. The fried chicken tenders were a little small but still had a great taste and made the dish wonderful.Two things to take note, the portions are pretty huge and there is always a big crowd at this place. Come hungry and be ready to wait some."
Sherwin D.,"Dallas, TX",6/10/2017,4.0,Great food. I had chicken and waffles and they were perfect. The chicken batter had a slight spice to it and it's salty/spiciness contrasted perfectly to the sweetness of the maple syrup. (I don't do gravy)Everyone else loved their meals too. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the service was very slow.
Brendan Z.,"Miami, FL",5/14/2016,3.0,"Over-hyped, underwhelmed?We were pretty excited to visit this much-talked about restaurant. We made a reservation ahead of time, but still had to wait 12 minutes before being seated. That's fine - they're busy and we get it.When our server came out, she hurriedly told us about the restaurant and whipped around before we had a chance to explain that my wife requires gluten free guidance (as we stated while making our reservation). Wouldn't be a problem... If it weren't for the fact that she only came to our table a few times the entire dinner.For appetizers we had the pickled vegetables and the deviled eggs. Both were good, but nothing to write home about. For dinner, I had the short rib and it was okay. The meat was tender but the sauce was very boring. A marinade was definitely in order. My wife's rotisserie chicken (one of the very very very limited gluten free options she had) was boring. The meat was dry and the only flavor was in the wing. They need to add a homemade dipping sauce if you aren't going to marinade or rub the entire chicken. Crop sides were measly portions compared to the meat center.Overall, we left unsatisfied and felt that Founding Farmers does not live up to the hype of Yelp. Considering all the other amazing, similar priced options in DC, we won't be recommending this restaurant to our friends when they visit here as well."
Lisa C.,"New York, NY",11/11/2016,4.0,"My friends and I visited DC for Labor day weekend. Because we were driving from NYC, I made reservations for a modest time just because we didn't know how traffic would be. Long story short, we arrived earlier than expected so went straight to the restaurant to have brunch. I don't think it was a very fair system that they have in place for seating tables. I clearly had a reservation that I was 30 minutes early for but they chose to seat people who were walk-ins before me? I'm not really sure what kind of sense that makes so I took off a star for that.By the time we sat, we all knew what we wanted already. Food arrived quickly and it was very satisfying. My lemonade was delicious and my carrot cake pancakes were spectacular. My friend ordered the red velvet pancakes which was absolutely terrible. It tasted like uncooked flour that happened to be dyed red. So fair warning, DO NOT ORDER that! Portions were very generous and splitting the bill was a breeze."
Evelyn P.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",6/26/2017,5.0,This place is great! I love the atmosphere! I got the lobster mac and cheese and it was delicious! Our waiter was great as well.
Sara M.,"Austin, TX",4/29/2017,3.0,"So, the first time I went here I was totally blown away. I've been back a couple of times since, and every time, my impression of this place dwindles a little bit with each visit. The first visit, we started off with the skillet corn bread, which was very good. For my meal, I went with the chicken bolognese bucatini, which was exceptional! Hubs had the chicken and waffles, and was pleased. He wasn't overly impressed with the chicken, but only in part because it had the bone in, and he prefers it without.. totally personal preference though. They have an elaborate drink menu, which I recommend trying out. We decided to give them a second try, and had Elliott as our server (this was about 2 years ago), and he was one of the best waiters that we've ever had out of all of the restaurants that we've ever been to. Kudos to him! Very personable, friendly, and went out of his way to make sure we had a pleasant dining experience. I went with the tried and true, chicken bolognese bucatini. It didn't let me down! Hubs had the fish and chips, and was left feeling gimped because he only got 2 medium size filets. This go around, we tried the beignets for dessert, which Elliott warned us would take some time as they're made fresh to order. Hubs and I both agreed that they were okay, nothing over the top. After leaving a pretty good impression on us, we decided to make reservations via the OpenTable app for our most recent trip to DC. We had to wait, even though we had reservations, but the wait wasn't too bad (10-15 mins). This was the case 2 years ago as well... Anyhow, they somehow cancelled my OpenTable reservation, so I didn't even get credit for my visit, so that kinda ticked me off. The waitress on this visit was a bit socially awkward, but I get it, some folks just aren't very good with people. Anyhow, hubs got the salmon with the candied sweet potatoes and he said it was some of the best salmon that he's ever had. Very juicy and loaded with flavor. I strayed away from my beloved bolognese dish, and opted for the chicken pot pie. My mistake! Not near as good as the pics looked, and there was a weird piece in it that caused me to lose my appetite. :( Bummer. I really wanted to love this place. I still like them, but not in love. In fact, we cancelled our second reservation here that we had booked for the end of our trip. Sorry, not sorry. For what it's worth, I'd say give them a chance. Our first and second visit was so good that I wouldn't trade those experiences in even with the fact we weren't overly thrilled with our third experience. Happy dining!"
Robin R.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",7/27/2017,5.0,This place there's nothing negative about it drinks and meal were beyond expectations would highly recommend must go reservations aren't required nuts must of you don't want a long wait. I'll definitely be back
Emily D.,"Wilmington, NC",8/17/2017,5.0,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in DC! I've been for brunch and dinner several times and have never been disappointed in the food or the service. I'm a vegetarian, and have been for almost 10 years, but on my birthday I ALWAYS get their chicken pot pie... if that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will!"
Becca S.,"Hillsboro, OR",6/9/2016,5.0,"This was the place I decided to start off my birthday, and it was a great choice!My sister and I came in for weekday breakfast and we wanted to share both sweet and savory options. As a result, we ordered the Strawberries and Cream Stuffed French Toast, the Founding Farmers Breakfast, and an order of Beignets. The french toast was AMAZING. The fact that it was stuffed with a cream filling put it over the top. I think it was the best french toast I have ever had. The grits in Founding Farmers Breakfast that we ordered were great. They were a larger grain than what I'm used to, but I liked the texture, and they had good flavor. Beignets came with three dipping sauces, and the fruit sauce was the clear winner. I also appreciated the fact that they added a candle to this for my birthday - it was a cute touch!Decorations were both polished and whimsical. I would definitely come back here if in the area; everything was very reasonably priced, and the food quality was high. We made a reservation, but they weren't crowded when we were there (a non-peak time - 10:30 AM on a Tuesday)."
Heng T.,"Dunwoody, GA",5/11/2016,5.0,"A friend recommended this spot to me while I was on a business trip. Luckily enough, I managed to grab a reservation the morning that I was planning on coming here. The place was absolutely packed even at 11:30 in the morning when a large line of people waiting by the entrance. There is a bar area downstairs with normal seating as well as additional seating upstairs.We started off with a bread, chips, and crisps basket that also came with 4 different spreads: romesco, pimento cheese, green goddess, and onion dip. I really enjoyed the pomesco which was a tomato-like spread as well as the pimento cheese. The basket was huge with foccacia bread and kettle chips along with crisps. The restaurant has the same menu for lunch and dinner so prices and portions are the same no matter what. The main thing with this spot is that they get all their ingredients from local farms.I decided to go with the chicken and waffles as my entree since it was listed as a signature item on the menu. The food came out really fast as we weren't even really done munching on the bread basket. It was a massive plate as it came with mac and cheese as well as a side of my choice which I chose whipped red potatoes. The fried chicken piece was huge while the waffle came with both butter and syrup. The chicken was so crispy and tasty while the mac and cheese was so rich but delicious. The whole entree came together perfectly, and I forced myself to finish the whole thing because I absolutely loved it.If I ever come back to DC, I plan on checking out some other items on this menu. It definitely lived up to the hype but I am glad that I had a reservation. The restaurant is very popular so make sure to get a reservation ahead of time but definitely worth checking it out!"

Updated review",5.0,"Another winning night!  I can't say enough about the servers - every one of them are excited about the menu and add to the rustic, yet upscale atmosphere.  They actually distill some of their liquor and hand press the juice! Clementine, Founders Choice and the Vodka/melon/cucumber drinks are really outstanding. Appetizers: Classic Deviled Eggs with some fess cracked salt- terrific! Skillet of cornbread too - order for appetizer and enjoy the honey and butter as you wait.Dinner: Shrimp and grits for me - huge shrimp, amazing gravy and andouille sausage (grits are great but hidden so ask for more and less sauce if you need to get your grit fix - which I do).  Enough for two with very large (about 7 shrimp). Served in big cast iron skillet so it stays hot.Cobb Salad - a load of shrimp, succumbed, avocado and more! Lightly dressed and amazing seasoning on shrimp. Dessert- Too full!This place was really the happening place near the White House - a year later and when I left, standing room only around the bar and at and the lobby.Parking - Easy - Garage is directly across street on Pennsylvania Ave and if you arrive after five - a flat $12, leaving you time to walk off the calories and see the White House a few blocks away!"
Guelsy D.,"Miami, FL",1/15/2017,5.0,"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! You will not be disappointed if you come here. I made reservations ahead of time (which I recommend because it's always packed). They sat us down as soon as we arrived. I had the chicken and waffles... WOW! The chicken was fresh, the eggs were delicious and the waffles were crispy and tasty. The syrup is infused with cinnamon so it was really good too. Also tried the mimosas which are made with freshly squeezed orange juice (and also strong in regards to champagne). Fantastic service and great ambiance. This is a MUST if you go to D.C."
Marie B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",12/6/2016,5.0,"Divine.  Truly. The Fried Green Tomatoes were ""mighty good""...like some little Southern grandmother was in the kitchen! The cornbread was equally yummy ...fluffy, not too cornmeal ,..and a teeny sweet.  The Steak is extremely good ~ tender, great seasoning and HUGE. A bargain at $28Hope this group considers other markets!  Yummy."
Nikki T.,"Chicago, IL",1/14/2017,3.0,"My intention was to eat breakfast. I didn't plan for a wait.  No breakfast for me. First on deck - Lemonade- Great flavor,  fresh and not overly sweet  (I love sweet btw)Chicken and waffle with Mac n cheese and veggies - 1/2. My mouth was watering as I looked at pictures if this dish...again I wanted the breakfast so the M&C didn't hit the spot for me.  The chicken was pretty good and the waffle was just ok UNTIL I introduced the butter and syrup. OMG the syrup was soooo good that I kept pouring it into the little waffle squares and taking a bite ( I don't like soggy waffles). Unfortunately the syrup wasn't enough to get the entrees 3 stars alone. Service -"
Eric L.,"Fairfax, VA",8/1/2017,4.0,Supper good food a bit over priced. Went during happy hour busy time don't suggest that so LOUD!
Kent H.,"Potomac, MD",6/6/2017,5.0,"The brunch in this location is very good, I enjoyed the coffee a lot, and the biscuits where very very delicious.  The cocktails also tasted very delicious.  I also liked the french press coffee"
Diana P.,"Highland Park, IL",4/21/2017,4.0,"We went for lunch-packed on a random Thursday but we had reservations so got seated within minutes of walking in. Everything is made fresh, no microwaves, etc. Cornbread and fried green tomatoes were outstanding but very rich. Both can be shared with 2-4ppl easily and that is a meal in its own. I got a salad, nothing special & my husband ordered the famous chicken pot pie which he said was VERY good and rich. It's more like a cream soup consistency. Location is great, fun place for friends and family to come in large groups."
Donald L.,"San Francisco, CA",5/10/2017,5.0,Another D.C. Staple. This is my goto breakfast place in DC. It's always consistent.  Strawberry and cream waffles are crispy and fluffy. I didn't get it this time but the side of BBQ bacon is amazing.  Great selection of alcohol as well. It's gets pretty crowded for lunch so either show up early or a little after lunch time.
Anna T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4/13/2016,2.0,"Called and made reservations for a Tuesday morning.  15 minute grace period or else reservations will be  forfeited. We did come late but we were lucky that it wasn't crowded and we still got to keep our reservations. Little did we know that the breakfast menu is up until 11am. So while waiting for the lunch menu to come out we ordered Beignets. Beignets- warm and fluffy and came with 3 dipping sauces (raspberry , caramel, chocolate) raspberry was my favorite.  Apple Brie bread- so delicious. The sweet honey onion on top goes so well with the apple. Totally recommend Chicken pot pie- not what I expected and saw from other yelpers. It wasn't covered like a pie how it is normally but with a biscuit in the middle and very salty with barely any chicken. Chicken and waffles- waffles were light and airy with a crisp. Mac n cheese was bland. Chicken was moist but slightly on the salty sideScallops and butter nut squash risotto- delicious at first but becomes a bit salty at the end. Small dish Service was horrible. Server was on her phone. Slow service during breakfast time. Hot chocolate drink was cold when it came out because she took so long to come back to us. Never checked up on us when the food came out. Overall, service was horrible and the food was mediocreAlso I didn't like how they had their restroom sign as "" Toilets"" it's just not a pleasant word to see and hear while eating. Also they have unisex restrooms 2 downstairs and a few more upstairs."
Matthew M.,"Washington, DC",4/26/2017,4.0,Founding Farmers offers a sprawling American menu with impressive cocktails to match. I have never been disappointed by a meal here in the many times we have been. The chicken and waffles and the sampler plate are two of my favorite dishes on the menu. Founding Farmers is a great place to find a well balanced and hearty meal. My only complaint is that they have a tough time managing their reservations. I have regularly had to wait 20-30 minutes past our reservation before we got a table.
Cecilia Y.,"Newark, DE",5/15/2017,4.0,"Mother's Day brunch with my friend, the food is amazing as always! However, we got a very rude waitress who decided to take the salt/pepper jar for another table by moving our plates away, WITHOUT saying anything even excuse me. Fourth time here, very bad service but great Benedicts."
May A.,"Fairfax, VA",7/31/2017,5.0,"I came here more than once and all the waiters and waitresses were friendly and attentive but I have never in my entire life came across a more helpful waiter. Kurtis was more that attentive, he got us warm napkins to wash off with after finishing our dinner and we had a baby with us he helped with the bag.. so sweet, such a gentleman."
Emma E.,"Chaska, MN",5/24/2017,5.0,"Pot roast: delicious rosemary taste, absolutely tasty.Chicken pot pie: served piping hot, very creamy and good.Pesto farm bread: bruschetta-style bread with something sweet hidden under the pesto. Apricot?Chicken and waffles: can't go wrong with that oneOverall a great restaurant that puts a lot of thought and intention into their menu choices. Highly recommended."
Maggie Y.,"Silver Spring, MD",12/20/2016,5.0,"I've heard about Founding Farmers and decided to stop by for lunch when I was in the city. I expected high prices from what I've heard from friends, but the menu choices were actually very affordable, especially for lunch. We arrived on a Monday around noon and put our names in for a table of 4, and were told that the wait would be around 45 minutes, so we decided to hang out at the CVS across the street, but when we came back to check 30 minutes later, we were told that our names have already been called and have been marked as no-show. We then explained that we were told to check back in half an hour and they gladly seated us, even though 2 members of our party were still on their way. Everything on the menu sounded delicious and I had a hard time deciding what to order. I ended up getting the chicken and waffles with mac and cheese and a side of green beans (you get the choice of a side). The portion was huge and I ended up having a whole another meal leftover, even though I planned on finishing everything that day! Everything was delicious and tasted very fresh.I'll definitely be back to try more deliciousness from the menu,including their house-made drinks!"
Kristin S.,"Austin, TX",6/2/2016,5.0,This place was sooo delicious! I went for brunch on a weekend which was pretty packed. The best thing to do is make a reservation. I had the stuffed French toast which was soooo freaking good! I also tried the fried green tomatoes that came with a sauce that was so good as well. The orange juice is make fresh and you can tell it's the real deal when you have it. This place is a MUST go to for brunch.
Ryley B.,"Austin, TX",7/25/2017,3.0,"Been here multiple times, this place is decent. The wait will be long at any time so make a reservation. The food is very overpriced and since the place is always busy the waitstaff is hardly attentive."
Lucy D.,"Littleton, CO",6/2/2016,4.0,"Had to try out Founding Farmers - especially for its farm-to-table mentality. Being from CO I was searching for a more local option in the hustle of the city with mostly everything being Corporate. The food was good - I had the Vegetable Bucatini and my friend had the Chicken and Waffles of course.I tried her mac and cheese and it was amazing! My pasta was also good, seemed a little standard and nothing really stood out as amazing. To me the experience in the end was a little corporate or basic. Living in Denver I'm used to a more authentic feel when the restaurant claims to be farm-to-table, but given the location I can see its more broad appeal.Overall, good dinner. Left full and satisfied. Would recommend checking it out for brunch and make sure you make a reservation!"
Paula L.,"Washington, DC",8/16/2017,5.0,"Staff was phenom even when customers weren't.  Four words Black Pepper Garlic Wings.  Outstanding.   Each dish was great, fresh, right for foodies!!"
Jess F.,"Manhattan, NY",6/18/2017,5.0,"Great spot for brunch with friends. The cornbread, crab cakes, and burger were delicious, and the service was friendly and fun. It's very close to GW law school in Foggy Bottom."
Claudia M.,"Glen Allen, VA",8/7/2017,5.0,"Every time I go here it is great service and delicious food. We also made a reservation but showed up an hour early and they sat us 5 min later so that was fantastic. Our server was also so sweet and very informative of everything, even down to recommending a dish in each section. We got Bloody Mary's which were so tasty. If you like spicy then this is your drink plus you get a pickled green bean in your drink. We got the prosciutto bread which was fig, marscapone and balsamic. The bread was so good and tasted smokey which enhanced the flavor. Definitely get one of those!! For lunch I got the chicken pot pie and my boyfriend got the rotisserie chicken dish. The pot pie at first was super hot but as it cooled it got a little thicker. It wasn't a full pie all over just topped with pastry crust which made it so much better. Added a bit of salt and pepper and it was perfect. His meal was also really good, the chicken had a savory skin and we do prefer more crunchy but still so moist. Overall love this place!! We wish that you all would come to Richmond,VA please please!!! It's hard for us to come to you guys often and really wish we had this more. Believe me, id get everyone hooked as soon as you did."
Ariana J.,"Providence, RI",11/29/2016,5.0,"Ate here during two work trips & loved it! The staff is friendly, the setup is nice, and the food itself is delicious. The centered bar really creates a vivid center & the bartender gave us great suggestions for our meal. Both times I ate here my coworkers and I split meals to have a sweet & savory mix. The hangover hash and beet hash were GREAT and the strawberries and cream waffle was probably 20% whipped cream - which was amazing."
Claudia C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4/8/2016,4.0,"Awesome food and awesome service.My friends and I checked out this joint based on a recommendation, and it was on point. As soon as you step in, you're immersed in a totally different ambiance than the facade deceives you to believe. It's a two story restaurant with tons of personality. The first floor is decked out with a nice open bar. The second floor has a ton of artsy decor.The food and service is exceptional. I ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice and chicken and waffles. We also got an order of beignets to share amongst the table. The juice was delicious, the chicken was flavorful and crispy and the waffles were light and crisp. Everything was delicious. The beignets were the perfect way to end the meal. Light and airy pillows of dough dipped in caramel, chocolate or raspberry jam. The server was very friendly and attentive.It's smack dab in the middle of downtown DC so you may reconsider driving here (it took us 15-20 minutes just to look for parking we couldn't find and settled for a parking garage close by).If you're in town and looking for a hip brunch joint, you gotta check this place out."
Cherise K.,"Madison, WI",10/20/2016,5.0,"You can't go wrong with this place. I mean 8,000+ reviews...i couldn't believe it. But believe me when i say its everything you could possibly expect and want. Definitely use opentable to make a reservation as you will still have to wait about 15 minutes just to get seated when you do because there will definitely be a line out the door...or at least crowding the waiting area. The drinks are superb whether you want a gin and tonic or one of their renditions of a cocktail, they have their list separated by alcohol to meet your fancy. I got whiskey drink that was a spin off of an old fashioned and it hit the spot. Appetizers: You HAVE to order the corn bread. it is probably the best cornbread i have ever had. Actual corn kernels, hot out of the oven, and fresh butter on the side. it melts in your mouth and then leaves a savory after taste lingering on your tongue. I also had the friend green tomatoes which had an amazingly tasty crust on it, but if you had to choose one I would go with the corn bread. Entree: Usually when i order with a big group we share some of our dinner. Not this time. we all got separate items and no one really had a chance to try each others because in a second it was gone. think fresh, tasty, delicious, best you could imagine food from the menu item that you ordered and thats what you get here. I had the goat cheese ravioli and my friend got the steak enchilada( which isn't really an enchilada, but the steak was cooked to absolute perfection, juicy, melt in your mouth) and the goat cheese in my ravioli was creamy delicious bliss. highly recommend both these items. I will definitely be back here if i ever get a chance to head to DC again, but until then, HAPPY EATING!"

Updated review",5.0,"Okay, I came back when I was in town again and this time I see what the hype is about! My friend and I both got something other than the chicken & waffles (which is overrated, see previous review), and both of our dishes were delicious! I got the eggs benedict with crab, which was super savory and had a decent amount of crab and perfectly poached eggs. I got hash browns for my side and they were crisp and really well-seasoned. My friend got the ranch steak & eggs, and the steak was cooked just right and flavored well. Both entrees were reasonably priced at $14. We also got seated upstairs this time, which I liked a lot better than the downstairs - it was spacious, well-lit, and had lots of elegant booths and window-side tables. Service was fast as well! I would definitely come back to try some of their sweet breakfast dishes."
George S.,"College Park, MD",8/6/2017,2.0,"I have heard so many good things about this place and couldn't believe the disappointment, made reservations the tone was honored was very happy about that. We were seated took about 10 minutes before we were greeted which is ehhhh pretty standard but not ideal, he starts us with drinks which took 20 minutes and asking of the waiter 3 times just to get an attitude and hear about it being what he thinks is crowded. Ordered cornbread the cut into the middle just to see it was half baked, sent it back grabbed a manager. He was very sincere with his replies to my issues and offered to make things right both choices on apps were great so kudos to him. Chicken and waffles should be renamed chicken and half a waffle, shrimp and grits were disgusting I brought my best friend here for her birthday and needless to say the night was ruined by poor service and bad food. Won't be returning or recommending to anyone at all."
Nach A.,"Port Deposit, MD",8/15/2017,5.0,Amazing food amazing service amazing atmosphere amazing drinks I recomend to Everyone
Tracey O.,"Randolph, NJ",8/15/2017,4.0,"This place was awesome. Everything fresh and homemade down to the soda syrups! Four of us, one preteen, one single digit kid, one picky adult, and another adult that will try anything once. Everyone was so happy. The only downside was the wait which was rather long. Get the chicken and waffles - you will not be disappointed!!"
Isaac D.,"St. George, UT",6/30/2017,5.0,"Visiting D.C and this was the perfect dinner! First off, the restaurant gives off a very fun and chatty vibe. Definitely a good place to talk or catch up with friends. But that's not all, complimenting the good vibe is amazing food. There is a wait but for sure worth it. If you don't get the, ""Chicken and Waffles"" or the ""meatloaf"" your missing out. Awesome staff, bar, and area. Definitely a must visit if you're passing through D.C!"
Janet L.,"Orange County, CA",10/21/2016,3.0,"I came here to say: yeah, I came here.I waited about five minutes after checking in for my reservation and appreciated that we were seated in a quieter upstairs.  From the pictures, I thought Founding Farmers would be somewhat more upscale, but it was a more relaxed atmosphere.Their mimosa was the same price of their delicious chicken and waffles which, unfortunately, was cold-to-warm upon being brought out.  We had no utensils to eat when the food was brought out, and the coffee jerk beverage I ordered wasn't out even as my meal was complete.  The server brought it out to me, complementary, with my check.I wasn't too impressed, but at least I can tell my DC friends that, yes, I've been here for brunch.  Next?"
Stephanie T.,"Chicago, IL",5/27/2016,5.0,"I've been to DC three times in the past 4 years and I always make sure to stop by this spot for brunch, even if I have to wake up for the first seating!  First off-- BEIGNETS. They are to DIE FOR!  They come with three sauces: raspberry, chocolate and caramel.  And they are fresh, fried, fabulous amazingness, hot right out of the kitchen.  Leek hash brown sides are brown and crispy and a unique spin on the traditional hashbrowns.  They come on the side of a lot of dishes, including all of the benedicts.  My favorite benedict is definitely the crab one.  It comes with jumbo lump crab with perfectly poached eggs.  Delicious food, great company and great service! Definitely will come back again next time I'm in DC!"
N. H.,"Southfield, MI",8/6/2017,4.0,"The service was great! We made reservations online and when we got there, 30 minutes early, our table was reasy! The food was delicious, my husband didn't like the fried chicken, he said he felt that they would have been better if the chef didn't hurry while cooking them! I had the chicken pot pie, it was good. Our appetizer, dates, bacon and blue cheese, DELICIOUS!"
John F.,"Vandalia, IL",5/21/2017,5.0,Popular!  Had reservations. Good food. Well cooked and prepared. Food is upscale traditional fare. Chicken and waffles!My flat iron steak was great. Kettle corn.
Charles F.,"Washington, DC",4/12/2016,5.0,"This is my first time at this location and I was very pleased with my entire experience!I've dined at founding farmers before however I haven't had a chance to try the breakfast and I was NOT disappointed.Upon arrival we were seated immediately. I ordered the red velvet pancakes and the farmers breakfast which came with different options. I chose scrambled eggs, applewood bacon and fruit. The pancakes were delicious and he cinnamon syrup was a great topping for the pancakes. The eggs were fluffy and delicious as well as the bacon and the fruit was very fresh. Everything was prepared to perfection!Oh and let me not forget to mention the orange juice which was absolutely some of the best orange juice I have ever had in my life! Tasted like they squeezed an orange right into the glass!All in all this was a pleasurable experience and I will certainly be back to try the carrot cake pancakes!"
Yoga M.,"Washington, DC",9/8/2017,3.0,"OK. Just OK. Food was average, atmosphere was very good. But I wanted the food to be better, given the wait and the hype about this place."
Allie Y.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",4/16/2017,4.0,"The farm breads are all delicious and the best items on the menu. The prosciutto is my personal favorite. The skillet corn bread is a hit or miss. Can be dry sometimes but when it's made right, sooooo delicious. Love the decor, great for groups, and lively atmosphere. Always make a reservation. Brunch is better than dinner. Drinks are made stiff. Expect to wait, despite a reservation. I try and order something new on the menu, as it is exciting and always sounds delicious. Knock one star cause there's always been a serious lag time despite reservations. I also totally understand cause it's super busy and popular."
Darin D.,"Fort Myers, FL",6/14/2017,4.0,"Food is very good. I had the chicken and waffles which came with Mac and cheese and green beans, a lot of food and very tasty. My wife had the meatloaf which she said was excellent.Bad part is seating and noise. We were sat at a tiny two top table very close to two other couples on either side and the noise was so loud we could barley hear each other talk.Overall it was a good experience and good service. I would've asked for a better table but they were so busy I didn't want to wait another 45 mins for one."
Patrick L.,"San Ramon, CA",10/17/2016,3.0,"I'm pretty lukewarm on Founding Farmers DC.  Strange, because I LOVE Farmers, Fishers, Bakers in Georgetown.Maybe it's the wait - even with reservations?Probably, the uninspired dishes I've had?Definitely the filthy bathrooms on the first level.First time there, I had the following sandwich:TURKEY, GRUYÈRE & HONEY MUSTARD $14  It was not nearly as good as it sounded - kinda dry 'n blah.Last night I had:CRANBERRY & BRIE VEGETABLE BURGER $13  It was delicious, but the plate was decorated with a tiny pile of salad greens and nothing else. Note to FF: just because I opted for no meat doesn't mean I wanted to eat like a bird. Throw some sweet potato fries on the side or at least a scoop of KEEN-WAH (ugh, I hate that stuff and my wife makes me eat it!)So, enough about me.  Last night my dinner mates ordered:SCALLOPS MEUNIÈRE & BUTTERNUT RISOTTO $24AndCHICKEN POT PIE (x2) $15The scallops dish was quite nice and the chicken pot pies were tasty and hearty.Maybe I'm personally ordering all wrong?  Seems likely.At least the service at the table was very good.Not sure I'll return...3.5 starsOkay, maybe ONE more try."
Danielle W.,"Indianapolis, IN",10/17/2016,5.0,5 Stars for service/food/drinks and atmosphere! The good:- cocktails were fresh and delicious - service was prompt and helpfulThe better:- fig and prosciutto farm bread - Goat Cheese Ravioli with Chicken Cutlet - Just YUM if you love goat cheese like I do!The best:- sausage and mushroom gnocchi was so so tasty- design concept is refreshingly uniqueI will definitely be back for more when I visit D.C.! It was my birthday and the bartender made a beverage special for me.
Taleen B.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",11/21/2016,5.0,Loved this spot!!! I am obsessed with gnocchi so that fact that this restaurant was serving a gnocchi dish it was an automatic five stars for me!!! My boyfriend wanted to sit at the bar so he could watch his football games while having a nice lunch. We had done all the tourists spots and we're ready to have a delicious meal. The bartender Ryan was very helpful and attentive. Of course I got the sausage gnocchi with mushroom on the side and as for my boyfriend he did the fish and chips. The drinks were so smooth and really hit the spot!!!
Sean D.,"Baltimore, MD",5/19/2017,2.0,"Honestly really over-hyped for price and taste. Super bland food, and extremely noisy on the inside. The two times I have gone have been during dinner - so I cannot speak for breakfast or lunch - but the place was so loud that we were basically shouting over each other to talk during the meal. Not a comfortable ambiance to say the least. There are so many better restaurants in DC to try when you come to visit. I urge you not to choose this one."
Sarah B.,"WEST HILLS, CA",7/27/2017,5.0,"When my mom, sister, and I were visiting D.C., Founding Fathers was definitely the best place to eat and soon became a favorite. They have delicious breakfast, lunch, and dinner with all meals made in house Founding Fathers is a must eat whether you are just visiting the capital or a resident of the area!!!!! In addition the staff is extremely nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant is wonderful as well!!!"
Tia C.,"Quincy, MA",8/4/2017,5.0,Came here for dinner and loved it so much that we made reservations for breakfast the next morning. Everything was delicious and made with fresh wholesome ingredients!
Brittney E.,"Lexington, KY",11/18/2016,5.0,"This place came highly recommended. I arrived on a Friday morning and there was already a decent wait for breakfast. Everything tasted so fresh and I'm a huge fan of the farm to table concept. I loved the sausage, mushroom and spinach scramble with hashbrowns and the grilled ciabatta. The mocha cappuccino complemented breakfast well."
Sharon H.,"Washington, DC",5/20/2016,3.0,"Okay, so I really hate it when people hype things up for me because I end up getting really disappointed when it doesn't play out to the standards that I expected. Founding farmers is the perfect example of this.My friend and I made reservations Here for a Saturday lunch at 1:30. It took us an hour...let me repeat...an HOUR to get seated due to overbooking. That was already a red flag for me. We then got seated and I couldn't even handle how crowded this place was. I was trying to zigzag in between people to get to our seat and lord knows what would have happened if I really needed to use the bathroom during my time here because I clearly remember at least 15 people queuing up for the lone bathroom on the first floor. That's besides the point - let's get down to the really knitty gritty of founding farmers, their brunch. I ordered their chicken and waffles while my friend ordered the egg Benedict but we were so hungry we decided to order their beignets as an appetizer, because who doesn't love a bit of fried dough and sugar?The beignets were absolutely worth the money and wait - 4 very reasonably sized donuts with three dipping sauces gave me a feeling of guilt but I gladly devoured those little niblets of heaven after the initial bite. No regrets. Best thing to happen to me that whole week. we then quickly got our main entrees, but we were pretty upset at the quality of the food. My waffles were a bit too dry as well as the chicken. My friends eggs were way too runny. In other words, it seemed like her food was made as a rush order, which greatly reflected off of the rushed atmosphere here. I guess it's a decent place to eat of you want brunch but in combination with the wait time, standard breakfast food, and mediocre atmosphere, I'd say either try to go when you know there will be no one around or try another brunch place (maybe near Shaw on U-street) that offers same quality food. I was disappointed by the food and service to say the least, but It wasn't terrible...maybe next time it'll be better."
Maddy L.,"Washington, DC",7/20/2017,4.0,"I am a Founding Farmers fiend. I go to all the iterations and locations. Their food is almost always delicious, but their service can at times be less than great. Their services lately all have had an attitude, which stinks because this place is like home to a lot of folks in the area. It certainly won't stop me from coming back."
Maryana S.,"West Rogers Park, Chicago, IL",10/12/2016,5.0,"Make a reservation! This place is really nice, the decor is very modern, noise level is on the higher side. The best flatbread that I have ever had is from this place, just wow! The shrimp fry had really really fresh ingredients! Would definitely recommend this place is you are vising DC."
Aalap H.,"Chicago, IL",5/1/2017,5.0,"I was in town for a couple days and looking for a good bite to eat with vegetarian options in the Foggy Bottom area on my walk back from site seeing at the White House. I found Founding Farmers on Yelp and got myself a seat at the bar (around 8pm on a Sunday, apparently it's quite often so packed there's a line). Service at the bar was great and the bartender worked to get me a cocktail I would like best (the ""better and better""). Nice to see a full ""Meatless"" area of the menu, my server helped me pick between multiple options I was considering. I ordered the Mushroom Risotto with the picked vegetables (because they were sadly out of the fried green tomatoes​). The food quality and taste was very good. The mushrooms were a little too vinegary for my tastes, but overall great. I've heard the cauliflower steak is very good, must try it next time. Overall a great experience and I would love to go again."
Drew K.,"Alexandria, VA",8/2/2017,5.0,"Staff was very friendly, bright & clean interior, small menu but the food was excellent! So much flavor. Definitely returning for more!"
Caitlin C.,"Halethorpe, MD",10/17/2016,4.0,"We came here on a Friday night for dinner with friends. I had made reservations and the other couple we were meeting were running 5-10 mins late; the hostess told us this wasn't a problem, but they wouldn't seat us. I find this incredibly frustrating, since we would have ordered a round of drinks and most likely a snack while we were waiting, but c'est la vie!Once we were seated, we enjoyed our dinner. My fiance and I split an order of the bacon wrapped figs and devilled eggs, I had the house salad, and we both had the salmon with red potatoes and green beans. Everything was DELICIOUS,  beautifully plated, and hot. My favorite dish was honestly the salad, with nuts and figs and grapes and tomatoes. BEST salad I've had in a very long time.We also sampled the house white wine and several drinks. IMO, the wine was a bit expensive for the quality, but it tasted nice and complimented every dish we ate. The drink with the rum and vanilla in it was a great option for dessert; we skipped the carrot cake since we were stuffed.Our waitress was prompt and VERY friendly. The only real complaints I have are the seating issue, as mentioned above, and it was very crowded and very loud."
Anup R.,"Brooklyn, NY",11/12/2016,5.0,The wait at this place is insane. 7pm on a Saturday was over 1.5 hours for table for 2. We decided to just check ouit the bar area which was also packed but we got lucky and found an opening with 2 seats. Brie bread tasted amazing. Didn't know I liked brie. The goat cheese ravioli with chicken was tasty as well. The menu overall all looked very appetizing and decently priced especially for the area.
Jessica H.,"Indianapolis, IN",9/28/2016,5.0,"This is one of my favorite restaurants that I've ever dined at. While in DC, you must check this place out! Plus any/all of their affiliate businesses!The craft cocktails are always made-to-order and very flavorful. My favorite are the mule-inspired drinks. Also, their craft beer selections are unique and there's something for everyone.Everything I've tried here when I've been in town has been fantastic, and I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town! The appetizers are delicious, and the most memorable for me has always been the farmbread. The fig and prosciutto is my favorite, but I'm sure the others are great as well! We've also shared the mussels before, which were delectable.Last time I was in DC, I ordered the sausage and mushroom gnocchi which was AMAZING. I love the sauce and the flavors blend together so well. I like that they serve it with a piece of bread to soak up the sauce. In the past, I have ordered the salmon, and that was very delicious and cooked perfectly. The desserts are also fantastic, with the carrot cake and red velvet cake being my favorites. Finally, the service is always wonderful."
Allyssa B.,"North Ridgeville, OH",8/1/2017,5.0,"Other than the almost hour and a half wait.... (OUR FAULT PLEASE MAKE A RESERVATION!!!!) Everything was unbelievable. The beer was outstanding (some kind of Czech pilsner) the fried green tomatoes were so so good . Mix the sauces, trust me. My husband got salmon prepared with wine, shallots, lemon and butter I believe with whipped potatoes and broccolini which was so so perfect. And I had the tomato soup and three cheese grilled cheese which was the comfort food that I had been craving. Our server was so sweet and helpful and we will definitely try and come back before we head back to Cleveland!"
Paige N.,"Charlottesville, VA",8/10/2017,5.0,"You absolutely must go here, and you absolutely must have a reservation. The food is incredibly fresh, responsibly-sourced, and very delicious. Brunch is fantastic, but other meals are equally good. Their classic breakfast plates are comforting and wholesome, and the menu includes so many other gems like fresh, decadent pastas and some fantastic southern dishes. The service is phenomenal. Caring, knowledgeable, prompt no matter how many tables are full, and charismatic. If you show up here without a reservation, you are crazy. Book a reservation on Open Table so you don't have to wait for 3+ hours in a small waiting area with the rest of the DMV population. Looking forward to my next visit!"
Michael P.,"Ann Arbor, MI",6/8/2017,1.0,"Not all it's cracked up to be. Veggies were not very fresh. Good fried food, of course, but not a lot of places in DC mess that up. Long wait for a table doesn't align with the quality of food/price point. Cocktails are a little weak."
Naimah S.,"Takoma Park, MD",8/10/2017,5.0,The best blueberry pancakes on earth! This is my go to breakfast spot. I also get the apple chicken sausage and peach bellini. I highly recommend Founding Farmers.
Danielle C.,"Snoqualmie, WA",4/28/2017,5.0,Went with some friends and enjoyed our time here. I ordered the ahi salad and loved it! My friends dishes were flavorful and detailed too. You can tell they put pride in the menu and make sure to offer the best to guests- we were impressed. I will be visiting this place next time I am in town!
Melissa L.,"Washington, DC",9/14/2017,4.0,"yum! nice place, fresh and local food."
Sophia H.,"Washington, DC",11/9/2016,3.0,"Ugh I wish I could like this place, but the food just didn't impress me. This restaurant is just over-rated for me. I came here twice for brunch -- 1st time, I got the sausage, mushroom, & spinach pan scramble, and 2nd time, two-eggs breakfast (with chicken-apple sausage). Both dishes were pretty good but very standard. The chicken-apple sausage was tasty and better than average though. One of my friends got the chicken and waffles, and she said it was possibly the best she's ever had. I tried a bite of her dish - again, I thought it was just pretty good. IMO, go to Miss Shirley's Cafe (in Baltimore or Annapolis) for the BEST chicken and waffles ever. Okay food but very nice service."
Tiffany D.,"San Francisco, CA",3/18/2016,5.0,"Why is this place so popular? It makes it unbearable to wait for it.  The anticipation to dine is anxiety being built up and (hard to admit) worth it!Their brunch is slam dunk and a classic American kind of dining!  It's soulfully fulfilling!  I love their fried tomatoes!  It's a perfect crisp and the dips to it, is a moment on the lips and forever on the hips kind of ordeal.  Bar is straight up there.  Great for mimosas and Bloody Mary for the daytime.  Evenings - time to get your drinks on!  They have American entrees for dinner as well.  Well deserving of the name, Founding Farmers.  Perfect title and cuisine for Washington, DC!  It's one of those spots where you have to visit when in DC!"
Marilisa S.,"Cary, NC",9/5/2017,1.0,"Very disappointed. I was expecting great food and decent service. We had reservations and still had to wait 30 minutes. Food was okay, not worth the wait. And the service was extremely lacking. We had a party of 6 and one member of my party didn't get his food until the rest of us were done with our meal and that was only after we asked 3 different people where his food was. When his food was finally brought out it was plopped on the table and no apology or acknowledgement of the delay. Also if you sit upstairs I recommend bringing a jacket as it was uncomfortably cold. I would not recommend nor would I go back."
Elle E J.,"Huntsville, AL",10/16/2016,5.0,"I'm always hesitant when a seemingly trendy place has great reviews. Do other reviewers actually love the food or do they just love what they're supposed to love because it's the hot spot?The former. Woah. Blown away. Let me start by listing everything my dinner mate and I ordered and devoured: 2 signature cocktails, 3 burger sliders (with fries) as an appetizer, chicken and waffles with mac n cheese and mint watermelon, and goat cheese and butternut squash ravioli with chicken cutlet and [incredible] bread, and 2 giant pieces of cake. All of that was only $88. For the quality of food and the experience, we were expecting a lot more. The flavors were perfectly paired on every dish and everything tasted so fresh. How can something be so rich and flavorful yet so light and not overwhelming? The cocktails were incredible. They were strong enough to give us a slight buzz but not overpoweringly liquored up. I got the Fall seasonal 'Carlisle' and I've never quite had anything like it. Very drinkable. We were pretty full by the end of dinner so we got the cake to go. GET THE CAKE TO GO. So moist. So yummy. The carrot cake's cream cheese icing almost had a hint of coffee in it...The vibe and ambiance were welcoming while also feeling luxurious. You must use the restroom while there. Yeah, that's strange, but it's cool -- cherry blossom wall paper and farmhouse sink. The fabulous service sealed the deal for 5.5 stars. Knowledgeable, friendly, inviting, and seemingly genuinely happy to be there."
Jessica L.,"Baltimore, MD",4/5/2016,4.0,"Overall lots of excellent veggie options!Also apparently they don't make ""mocktails"", really? So I ended up ordering the Rickey soda which was excellent, Limey, and delicious.Everyone raves about the fried green tomatoes but I would say they are just good,not amazing, the dipping sauces were excellent tho! Can share among 2-3 people.I loved the meatless section of the menu. I adored their cranberry and Brie veggie burger. It had a really smooth but rich texture which was so filling and tasty. Came with an arugula salad that was just ok.For dessert highly recommend the beignets. They sometimes take up to 20 mins to make but ours came out super fast. 6 huge beignets we shared among 3 adults with 3 dipping sauces. So satisfying. Can't wait to come back. Reservations a must."
Johanna B.,"Washington, DC",8/14/2017,2.0,SOOOO OVERHYPED! The wait is so long even if you have a reservation and the food is not at all worth the price.
Marc O.,"Bridge City, LA",7/30/2017,5.0,"Went on a Sunday at lunch and had to wait for about an hour for a table. But glad we did, the service was great and food amazing. Everything is made from scratch. We loved the chips and breads. My wife had the shrimp, daughter had the fish and chips. My boy had the goat cheese burger, and I had the flank steak. Also the family shared a huge huge slice of carrot cake. I highly recommend this place if your in the DC area."
Rashaad W.,"Washington, DC",5/23/2017,4.0,"My my my my- this place is AMAZING.  Went here for the first time over the weekend and can't put into words how great the food was. I had the pot roast with garlic blackened pepper wings.  The pot roast was savory and over mash potatoes- well seasoned and savory.  The garlic blackened pepper wings are finger licking good and tasty.  The only thing I did not like was the cornbread, although it was good- it appeared to be uncooked."
Peri Elizabeth M.,"Miami, FL",5/7/2016,5.0,"This was by far, the best brunch experience I've ever had! Everything was made from scratch- and I mean everything! The orange juice is a must try! We saw everyone at the bar ordering a Bloody Mary so I wanted to try it, it was very good if you like them spicy. The waitress was very attentive and the ambiance was great! It also helps that there were 50 people waiting and we got two seats at the bar right away :) If I could give this more than 5 starts I would!"
Quinlyn S.,"Kensington, MD",8/8/2017,3.0,I have been to founding farmers many times and at all locations. There good is always amazing--especially the appetizers and pastas. There is something on the menu for everyone. However my service is almost always slow and subpar.
Paige A.,"Wesson, MS",6/13/2017,4.0,"I went in expecting mind blowing, but came away with a good meal. The lemonade was really great and the kettle corn made for a fun treat before the main meal. The atmosphere was nice in a Sunday afternoon.We had the Ribeye, Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese, Cheeseburger, and the Fish of the Day With the Meunière."
Miriam G.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",8/13/2017,3.0,"Honestly, this place has a lot of hype, and I was definitely let down. The food is decent but nothing too out of the ordinary or high quality, and the eggs benedict was pretty salty. The fruit was not fresh or good quality, and seemed like a fruit salad from Safeway, to be honest. The best part of the meal was the English muffin, which was homemade and really tasty.The ambiance is nice, and the service is good, but for the price, you can definitely get better food elsewhere."
Derek L.,"Boston, MA",4/23/2016,4.0,"Founding farmers. The wait here is exceptionally long for 9pm dinner. Try to get here early or make a reservation. I ended up sitting at the bar.The setting is dimly lit and a bit classy. Service was great and the food was delicious.I had the fried green tomatoes for an app. The chicken pot pie (which they use a biscuit instead of a crust) and carrot cake with ice cream for dessert. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. I think the food is reasonably priced for the setting and the experience is quite nice."
Bre Y.,"Washington, DC",11/2/2016,5.0,"A guaranteed great meal of all times of the day and great customer service! It's always busy considering the high quality of food and reasonable prices. I have been several times but love their breakfast, the stuffed French toast, the chicken and waffles, the eggs (actually seasoned unlike other places), the chicken sausage, the everythangg! There's a variety of fresh sauces for the bread that comes with the meals. Be sure to ask what type of jams they have for the day, it often changes. The Beignets are a must try. I love the variety of sauces that come with them as well. They are perfectly crispy and smothered with powdered sugar!Although I'm obsessed with their breakfast, I'm looking forward to returning very soon to try their dinner menu!"
Misty M.,"Washington, DC",7/29/2017,3.0,"I like the food here, but the service is generally lacking.  Overall, the place seems to be over-hyped; there are plenty of better restaurants nearby.  I generally only come here when I am invited or when I have folks from out town that have requested it."
Katie H.,"Washington, DC",11/1/2016,3.0,"I was really excited to try this restaurant, as I had heard good reviews, but it didn't live up to my expectations. We had a reservation but still had to wait, and the place was really crowded (people clogging up the entry-way, etc). The food was pretty decent, but nothing spectacular. We shared the corn bread to start which was alright, and then I followed with the Scallop risotto, which I enjoyed. Overall, i don't think this place quite lives us to its hype, but it's a decent lunch place."
Earl W.,"Southwest Washington, Washington, DC",8/7/2017,1.0,I brought my grandmother here for her birthday she ordered the crab cakes and I ordered the Salman our food was awful my grandmother didn't like the crab cakes but she ate them because she didn't want to waste my money and I paid $90 plus a $15 tip but as long as I took my grandma out it's cool
Cecilia B.,"Seattle, WA",8/7/2017,4.0,"On my visit here, I tried the french press coffee, over easy eggs, pork sausage, side breakfast salad, hash browns, and the poached egg pastrami hash. The pastrami hash was delicious and the hollandaise sauce was the best part of the meal. The best hollandaise sauce I have ever had. The eggs, sausage, salad, and hash browns were extremely average and I would not order them again. The worst part of the meal was the french press coffee, which was surprisingly terrible. It was very, very silty and was hard to drink due to all the residue in the bottom of the cup. If I went back for a second visit, I would make sure to have coffee at home before I go so I don't have to get any there. I would absolutely recommend anything with the hollandaise sauce, though."
Marika C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",11/18/2016,4.0,"I came here last Saturday for my boyfriend and I's 5 year anniversary. We can here for dinner and the wait was about 30-45 minutes long. We tried to come back on 30 minutes but were a little late and they had already called our names, but they still sat us which was nice. The place was packed. We sat at one end of a table and there was another couple on the other end. (So there was one seat in between us.)I ordered the rotisserie chicken and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. I also got the lemon lime craft soda. Okay, so the craft soda was so good!! It was like the best so I'd ever had.My rotisserie chicken was salted perfectly - the skin was good. When I first got the plate and saw that I only had 3 potatoes I thought it wouldn't be enough, but it was. The side vegetables I got were cold, which I was disappointed in because I thought they would have been warm. My boyfriend's fried chicken was good. He liked it a lot, I however found the taste to remind of a TV dinner chicken, but he said I was wrong lol. His waffles were so good. I'm anti-waffles, but I couldn't stop eating it and the syrup was so good. My boyfriend loves mac&cheese and he really liked the one we had here. I brought back some of the waffle and the Mac&schemers to my mom and she even was like, ""this is really good.""We will definitely be back! And probably with a reservation this time, ha"
Whitney P.,"Manhattan, NY",11/26/2016,5.0,"We were visiting D.C. for the Thanksgiving holiday and came here for our Thanksgiving meal. I didn't make reservations early enough, but lucked out and were seated right away when we walked in. There was a fixed menu of traditional Thanksgiving food. We didn't know anything about the menu before hand, so I was super excited about that! Everything was delicious and truly tasted like a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal. I look forward to trying Founding Farmer's everyday menu next time we visit."
Jack B.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",5/8/2017,2.0,"I got the humongous buffet @ brunch.  Too many choices...avoid too much bread/waffles except with the fried chicken/pancakes There are  2 types of fried chicken, prime rib/ sides/salad varietals and save room for dessert. Having said that, the service, while amiable, sucked. Coffee took forever to get there (and we were 15 feet from the urn). I was the only buffet-goer so each of the other 5 diners ordered off the menu. Ranged from superb (crab cakes) to meh? A ""snapper"" in a limpid, flavorless sauce. They brought around Ala carte appetizers but it did not compensate for the sl-------oow service. Price-wise the buffet is an average cost but the entrees were top-of-the market (the crab cakes were very pricey). Watch where you are seated so that you are not blinded by the southern sun. If I go back it will mainly be to try their ""craft"" liquors, the Rye in particular."
Laura G.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",9/17/2016,4.0,"To be candid, this restaurant kept popping up in my search for great places to eat but the menu is full of comfort food - not really my ideal.  After a few friends that knew we were in DC told us we had to go we biked here from the Capital Building.  The ambiance was warm, inviting and homey.  We were there for a late lunch and knowing we had a dinner in the not too distant future we ate light.  We started with the traditional deviled eggs.  NOTE TO SELF:  Onion in deviled eggs is delicious.  My husband wanted to try the sandwich with mushrooms, cheese on a grilled bread - highly recommended by our waitress.  We share it and it was without a doubt D E L I C I O U S.   So damn good.  The girl next to us was raving about the red velvet cake - said it was the best in the word - bold statement....We will have to go back to try it.  I'm not a comfort food type of gal - but this restaurant could change that....."
Lauren H.,"Provo, UT",5/20/2017,4.0,"I feel like this restaurant is a little over-hyped. We went at 3 in the afternoon and there was still a 30 minute wait, so it's just packed all the time. That being said, we had a lovely meal. We started with the fried green tomatoes. I don't even like tomatoes and I thought these were great. We asked for some ranch sauce because we don't love goat cheese or Greek goddess dressing which it was it came with. Their homemade ranch is delicious. We also got the pot roast which was quite good. The blend of flavors of the roast, onions, mashed potatoes, and beans was awesome. We also got the butternut squash mascarpone ravioli and that was really bland. I couldn't finish it because there was no flavor to it at all. However, our server, Kathryn, was so nice and made the entire experience really great. She made us feel very welcome!"
Tamiko W.,"Charlotte, NC",7/10/2017,5.0,"Oh my gosh! This place is phenomenal.  My boyfriend and I visited Founding Farmers over the 4th of July weekend for lunch before heading to the National Mall for the day. We didn't make reservations, which was probably the first mistake, but luckily, we found a spot at the bar within 15 mins. Otherwise, we were looking at a 1 hour and 15 min wait. For the appetizer, we had the cornbread. It came in a mini skillet (super cute) and really good; not too dry, not too sweet. For our meals, I had the chicken pot pie and my boyfriend had the fish and chips. The chicken pot pie was the BEST pot pie I've had in ages. The breading was delicious and the chunks were a decent size. Usually, pot pie doesn't fill me up, but I could only eat about half of this serving. I also tried the fish and chips meal and it was just as great! The service was also wonderful. Our server/bartender was super nice and very quick with putting in orders and getting us everything we needed. I wish I lived in DC. This would definitely be a regular spot for me. We'll definitely be back again when we're in DC visiting family."
Naomi G.,"Washington, DC",4/13/2017,2.0,"Went for lunch. Our waitress was great. Chicken salad delicious. Lemon lime soda so refreshing. ordered a cheeseburger medium well. It came out oozing blood. Mind you I like my steak that way but not my burgers. I asked them to throw it back on but they instead gave me a brand new one. Props for that. However, a burger takes a minute to cook. So I sat waiting for awhile and ate some of BFs salad. Ok not the worst problem...but how an American restaurant messes up a burger is baffling.What is really bad is that when we were getting ready to go, bf very politely asked a waitress walking by if we could get our check (because ours was in the weeds).  She said abruptly with a scowl ""I'm not your waitress but I can ask her to get your check."" I was like woooooow rude much?? We know you aren't the waitress. Come on. Customer service sucks these days. Annnyywway - just like that, we aren't coming back. I coulda forgiven the burger miss. And BF works right at the IMF. Business lost. Boom."
Sam B.,"Philadelphia, PA",12/7/2016,5.0,"AMAZING. My friends and I came for brunch this weekend and as expected, the wait was 1.5 hours. Which was completely fine because we wanted to explore anyway and it gave us time to walk by the White House and National Christmas tree. Once our names were called we were promptly seated upstairs- so nice and cozy!The food was amazing and the service was fast. We got cornbread, beignets, chicken and waffles, sausage and gravy eggs benedict with hash, and bacon. Everything is made in house and delicious. I'm not even sure what my favorite dish was but everyone felt the same way- we loved it all! The portions are large and the price is very reasonable for brunch! Can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu. Honestly we didn't even get drinks for brunch so that we could use all our calories toward food."
Jeff W.,"Alexandria, VA",8/6/2017,5.0,"Love this place!  We had reservations for 12 for my wife's birthday dinner. Sat us quickly on a Saturday! Our service was awesome!  Our server was fun, helpful and interacted with all of us.  Wanted to make our night special.  The food? Whoa!  So good! Drinks were great!  They even accommodated having a special cake delivered and made fridge available for the cake, which was large.  This place is just awesome. Great food! Highly recommend!"
Adey P.,"Washington, DC",8/11/2017,5.0,One of my favorite restaurants that I can always count on for a great meal and great dining experience.  Reservations recommended. Always outstanding service. A brunch favorite!
Melissa M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/14/2016,5.0,"If you haven't heard of Founding Farmers, have you even heard of Washington DC? Any trip to our nation's capital must include a visit to this food capital. I'm pretty sure this is the founding father of the recent farm to table movement. These type of restaurants are popping up everywhere. They already form a food nation, but should pay respect, give credit to and celebrate their culinary papa, Founding Farmers, with a holiday. The first time I visited five years ago, I ordered French toast.  I normally don't like French toast, but there something about the look of the plate passing by caught my eye. Glad I got a glimpse because I wanted to toss my eggs in the air in syrupy carb bliss! This past trip, I went with the lunch fare. We started off with Devil-ish eggs. Poke me with a pitch fork, they were worthy of that name. Roast me, toast me or burn me in the pit, as long as I get some of those eggs!For my main, I ordered the turkey, gruyere and honey mustard sandwich. The bread alone would've earned five stars. The turkey was Thanksgiving level caliber and I wanted to shake the farmer's hand and learn the 's name. The fries on the side didn't get as much attention from me because my stomach was filled with the life cycle of a bird, but they were delicious as well. All that to say, eat here or you didn't really eat in DC."
Tina L.,"Chicago, IL",3/7/2016,5.0,"This was probably my favorite meal in DC. I absolutely LOVED all our dishes that we ordered! We were there in time for both the breakfast and lunch menu. AWESOME SAUCE! Here's a blurb from their website:""The food prepared in our Founding Farmers kitchens is made in-house, from scratch every day. Our dedication to serving high-quality, real, farm-to-table food is what sets us apart. We bake our own bread (approximately 118,000 loaves per year), we grind our own beef, we press our own juices, we even churn our own butter. Our purveyors are carefully chosen and measured against our high standards.Our menus are inspired by our country's rich culinary tradition, including our versions of all-American classics, as well as innovative creations based on a wide range of American cuisine.Simply put, it's real food & drink.  All served with pride.""I highly recommend trying the shrimp and grits (with andouille), the skillet cornbread (AMAZINGLY soft and moist) and the fried green tomatoes. Just so you know...the next time I come to DC, I'm coming here for a meal for sure.From the breakfast menu, we ordered ""From the Range"" and got the ranch steak & eggs (scrambled) which comes with leek hash browns, tomatoes, and your choice of bread. We got the English muffin, which was great with jam.The skillet cornbread is served with sea salted honey butter. So...as I mentioned above, the cornbread was so good by itself. But with the sea salted honey butter, I was in HEAVEN.The shrimp and grits were prepared well: the grits weren't too runny or mushy, it was the perfect texture. And the shrimp was cooked to perfection as well. I kept going in for more bites even though I was so full.Stay hungry, my friends!"
Randon W.,"Washington, DC",7/27/2017,2.0,"Food is great here, but for a recent client lunch I had a 12:00 pm reservation and was not seated until 12:45. Completely unacceptable. I was with clients as well which only exacerbated the situation and made me look unorganized. If I have a reservation, that doesn't mean 'seat me whenever you feel like.' Don't take reservations if you can't fill them. Waste of time. Won't be back."

Updated review",5.0,"Last night at Founding Farmers was perhaps my 6th time there in the past year. As always the food was excellent: you can't go wrong with the chicken and waffles or the farmhouse platter.But unlike my previous visits, I was pleasantly surprised with the improvements they've made service-wise. In the past, despite having a reservation I've had to wait close to 45 minutes to be seated- a standard waiting time if you don't have a reservation but unacceptable if you have a reservation for this type of venue. So I was pleasantly surprised when upon showing 10 minutes early for our 6pm reservation, we were immediately seated.Another refreshing improvement was the staff: everyone was friendly, not looking like they hate their job, and went above and beyond when dealing with my girlfriend's annoying requests without making a stank face.Truly a great DC restaurant. I hope they continue to expand and thrive without lowering their culinary and service standards."
Chris W.,"Washington, DC",8/5/2017,5.0,"Amazing food that was worth the wait. Getting into this restaurant can be tricky as it's always packed, but once you get in, the service and the food is simply amazing. Simple yet tasty and full of flavor. They make simple dishes that are simply out of this world good."
Matt B.,"Walla Walla, WA",5/31/2017,5.0,"I'm just a tourist, but honestly the best food we have had in DC. I had the blue cheese burger and it was so good! My wife had the fish and chips and it was the best I've ever tasted. Our server William did such a great job... we LOVE Founding Farmers!!!!!"
Cindy F.,"Oakland, CA",4/13/2017,2.0,"This was the place people kept telling me to try. Made a reservation and good thing. There were tons of people waiting to get in. Not sure what the fuss was about though, since our food was beyond salty. I have to say the cook must have lost at the track, since all the food was beyond salty. The hubby ordered chicken and waffles. Now my guy usually would have scarfed that puppy up, but even he left half the chicken on his plate. I had ordered the shrimp and grits and it was salty too. I could only get through half. So maybe folks just like the decor? It is a nice spot, but I don't think I would wait in line to get in here."
Jack D.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/20/2016,1.0,"So, after an hour and fifteen minute (good sign) wait...we finally got seated.  Ordered our food and drinks. Had  2 Bloody Marys $13 each, while waiting.  It's decent on the spicy side.  Had better!WARNING BEER LOVERS: My beer is warm, they claim to have craft beers but the darkest beer they carry is a blonde, lol.  Not even a red...?Chicken n waffles; I'm pleasantly surprised the chicken is excellent, the herbs and spices perfect.  Waffles a huge failure.  I have a waffle machine at home I paid $29.  I think they have the same one here.Cheeseburger, a bigger disappointment as it wasn't seasoned at all.  Asked Medium, it came our medium rare, the fries came out cold.  Manager came over, the same plastic smile ""is there anything I can do to make it better"" Yeah! Get my order right, season your meats, and get a better waffle maker.Seriously, I'm not impressed!The Real FoodieJust keepin' it real FF"
Ciara Lene G.,"North Las Vegas, NV",3/21/2017,4.0,"Starving and having just landed in Washington D.C., my boyfriend and I saw this establishment on Yelp on the train ride to the city. Seeing the raving reviews, we decided to make a reservation.I would strongly suggest making a reservation. Without it, I would have been looking at waiting 30 minutes to an hour at 10:45AM on a Monday. However, make sure you come on time, as they only have a grace period of 15 minutes before cancelling your reservation. Be aware that lunch starts right at noon. If you want the delicious breakfast menu, come earlier!The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing. Words of wisdom on the bathroom walls, chandeliers, and trendy artwork was a big eye-catcher. There are two floors, so there is a lot of seating, It was very spacious and I really appreciated all the natural light pouring into the establishment.Service was great. Our waitress was more than helpful with recommendations and food came out fairly fast. Portions were decently sized and worth the money.Uncle Buck's Beignets ($8): 3/5. 5 beignets dusted with powdered sugar. Sauces include caramel, strawberry, and chocolate. Salivating over the thought of the beignets I have tried in New Orleans, I was hoping this would satisfy the months-long craving. Sadly, it was just okay. Biting into the puff of sugary dough, my tongue was a bit turned off by how much oil was seeping through the cracks. Thankfully, the trio of sauces helped cut the grease. However, I believe beignets should not need to be covered in anything else but sugar to be fantastic. This was sadly disappointing.Traditional Eggs Benedict with Ham ($10): 4/5. Name says it all. I chose to have hash browns on the side. Nothing too spectacular about this. The bread was a bit tough to cut with a knife and I had to chew for a good minute before being able to swallow. The hash browns were crunchy, but learning more toward slightly burnt.The experience was enough to get me to come back in the hopes of trying something else. Though it isn't the best brunch I have ever tried, it did the job and was enough to fill me up for a while."

Updated review",2.0,"Founding Farmers expanded their menu several years ago to add an emphasis on meatless meals. They included an equal amount of vegan and vegetarian offerings. Fast forward to today and I discovered that this is no longer the case when I returned from a three-year hiatus from this restaurant.It was a weekday afternoon and Founding Farmers was packed! We had a reservation for 11:45 a.m. In most popular restaurants in DC, they begin to fill up around 12:10 p.m. and are packed by 12:30 p.m. This restaurant looked like it just stayed busy all day long. We got there on time, but waited as several parties were also waiting to be seated. They finally seated us by the window on the first floor.Founding Farmers is a huge restaurant with two floors and a basic, slightly boring decor. They pride themselves on making everything in-house including their breads and they remain a popular lunch and dinner choice in the city.There is a Meatless section on the menu, but when I inquired as to what I could have that is vegan, the server said there wasn't much. I decided to start drinking and ordered a nice glass of white wine. That usually makes everything better. :-)  The Pickled Seasonal Vegetables were the only vegan appetizer so we ordered that. It was mostly cucumbers that weren't crispy and were in way too much vinegar. We were not impressed.For my entree, they said there was only one vegan item I could order, so I ordered that. Everything else had some sort of butter in it and she did not offer to see if they could make it without the butter so I settled on the Rice and Bean Burger with Smoked Tofu and a salad. The salad was mostly arugula with some beets in lemon juice and while it was simple, it was quite good.The Rice and Bean Burger itself was great, but the presentation of the burger under a huge white bun wasn't so great. Neither was the white bread or the iceberg lettuce. They were skimpy on the smoked tofu as well by adding just 1.5 slices on top of the burger. This meal could be much improved with an artisan wheat burger bun, field greens instead of iceberg lettuce and thick generous portions of the smoked tofu.I also had an herbal tea to end the lunch.I feel so conflicted as I really like Founding Farmers and what they stand for, but I left disappointed. I know they can make great meals as I've had great meals in the past and I'm disappointed that most of the meatless dishes are not vegan. The burger was good, but the accompaniments were not, which took away from the meal. And for a $13 burger, I expect more. The service was very slow for a weekday lunch as well, but that is something they are known for. Lots of room for improvement here."
Jenny K.,"Oak Lawn, IL",7/17/2017,2.0,"Called ahead to make a reservation for Breakfast. I specifically asked if I could make a breakfast reservation and said I wasn't sure if that was just lunch or dinner and he said no they can take a Breakfast reservation. They made my reservation for 11:15 and then we got there and we were told Breakfast stopped at 11. What a waste, we wanted Breakfast not lunch!"
Kassie G.,"Chicago, IL",6/25/2017,2.0,"Amazing cornbread, but we had to send the mac and cheese back for being cold and salty, and it came back warm, but still super salty. All in all - great prices but the mac and cheese was horrible."
Len W.,"Haymarket, VA",6/25/2017,5.0,"Wow... great food that leaves you speechless although my partner ordered the cauliflower steak.. which I found unappealing. The drinks here are wonderful too. If I didn't mind the semi-mid pricetag and travel, I would come here everyday to eat dinner."
Sara M.,"Chicago, IL",9/3/2016,1.0,"I am from Chicago, and was visiting a friend who moved to DC many years ago. When I arrived she told me about this reservation and how she came her all the time in undergrad and it was great but recently the Washington post posted a zero star review for the place. So we decided to still go and than I would read the review after to see if we agreed. I 100% agree with the Washington post review. We were seated about 10 min after our reservation. (Not too bad highly recommend making a reservation if your heart is set on this place). We were seated and only given 1 menu, waited about 15 min for the waitress who than realized we didn't have water or anything and so proceeded to get that before seeing if we were ready to order or anything. I ordered the chicken and waffles, the guy next to me had ordered them (the breakfast order) and for whatever reason my portion was half the size of his.   So not only small portions the eggs and chicken were way over salted and my chicken portion was like a chicken McNuggets size. My friend ordered the Vegetable scramble she said Denny's was better. Nothing felt farm to table in that scramble. I agree 100% with the scathing Washington post review, it's not worth the wait, or annoyance of on over crowded, loud, slow service restaurant, with poor tasting food.Here's the Washington post review for your pleasure washingtonpost.com/lifes…"
Kiela J.,"Palm Springs, CA",6/21/2017,5.0,We were in DC and heard about this restauarant and decided to try it.  Unfortunately we couldn't get reservations but scored two seats at thr bar. I had the rotessuire chicken which was amazing.  Started with the blue cheese bacon dates and hubby had the filet. Green beans were delicious. Definitley will try to come back on next visit.
Jes S.,"Toronto, Canada",4/17/2016,5.0,"I absolutely love this place! The wait was an hour but well worth it. My friend and I shared the ahi tuna salad as our appetizer- it had tuna, avocado, cabbage and various veggies. Definitely a great choice, even as a meal! The dressing was wonderful- waitress said its their Kung pai dressing made in house.I also had the butternut squash ravioli for my main meal. It was delicious! The ravioli were huge pieces, and I definitely had to pack up the rest for later. Will definitely be going back, but also to try their brunch.I would recommend making a reservation well in advance to avoid the wait."
Nancy D.,"Palm Bay, FL",8/30/2017,5.0,"Great breakfast.  Healthy portions.  Great service.  Reasonable prices for D.C.  The French toast is amazing!  The pan scrambled sausage, mushroom, spinach eggs with hash browns and English muffin was great."
Nancy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/24/2016,4.0,"High-class diner. Make reservations in advance or you'll be waiting for more than an hour to get seated. To be honest, it's way too hyped up for the quality of food. I ordered chicken and waffles with a side of Mac and cheese and watermelon. The skin of the chicken was not crunchy and quite bland. I was disappointed that the meat was dry as well. To be honest, I've had better fried chicken from Albertsons. The waffles were light and fluffy. I enjoyed them a lot, but I wish I was given more syrup. Literally, all the syrup I was given did not even have enough to fill up two ""square holes"" of a waffle. The Mac and cheese was delicious and I enjoyed their choice of bigger sized noodles. The watermelon was crisp and fresh.Overall, good food but a bit expensive and over hyped!"
S. D.,"Montville, NJ",9/2/2017,5.0,Excellent food and atmosphere - The staff was extremely helpful and understanding of our tight schedule . I suggest you make  reservation.
Shannon V.,"Alexandria, VA",3/4/2016,5.0,"We made reservations here for brunch at noon on a Sunday. We arrived early and were not seated until noon on the dot. We had a booth near the bar, the place was absolutely jam packed but I was expecting that. Our server arrived promptly and explained everything to us and answered a lot of questions we had. We all started with some drinks and a few appetizers. The drinks took awhile to come out but we expected that with the craft cocktail nature and the sheer amount of people. We started with the beignets, a pimento bread, and bacon lollis. All the food came out so fast! Everything was delicious. The beignets were light fluffy and crispy and the sauces they came with were amazing (don't judge but I totally licked the raspberry sauce clean when we were done). Cocktails were amazing! I had the clementine and it is easily the best tequila cocktail I have ever had. So smooth with a hit of the spice which was not over powering at all. My dad had the bloody marry and I actually liked it even though I hate tomato juice. My mom had the Sazerac and it was perfect for her, she loves rye. Entrees came out and were delicious too. The chicken was crispy, moist, and everything you want with chicken and waffles. The potatoes were good but the star was the mac and cheese, perfectly cheezy. My husband had the hangover has which was good but he had some FOMO after tasting my dads pastrami hash. We were having an indulgent weekend so we decided to splurge on dessert and got the carrot cake and the chocolate mouse. Our server did warn us they were huge but we were being fatties no matter what. Both were delicious and we ended up taking them home to finish later that night. The carrot cake was moist and the frosting was just right, not too sweet, a great balance. The chocolate mouse was light yet decadent with the caramel drizzle. Our meal was great and our server was amazing! She really took her time with us and answered a lot of questions we had about the menu. I know some people may think it is over hyped but I loved it and will be back. You just have to know its crazy busy and packed and be ok with that."
Ezio D.,"Bradford West Gwillimbury, Canada",7/15/2017,4.0,"Big environment big portions of classical no nonsense made food at great (not cheap, great) prices. Sit at the bar and watch the bartenders do there thing everyone seems to take there job very seriously. Just went for desserts sadly beignets were pretty amazing and the carrot cake massive and moist. Interesting selection on beer taps they make sure to have 1 single type of beer offered on 5 or 6 taps I.e an APA a double IPA a wheat a pilsner/lager a stout which I haven't experienced that elsewhere or maybe just never noticed it. I'll be back for dinner"
Christine S.,"Dupont Circle, Washington, DC",9/14/2016,5.0,"Excellent, excellent service. Not just the kind of service where it doesn't interfere with your experience of the food, but rather the kind of service that made us feel welcome and cared for. I'd give six stars to our server if I could.I ordered the rotisserie chicken for dinner, and the half-bird I received was so filling I had to take some of it home with me. The food here is about 4.5 stars - pretty much everything is on-point, but there are just some items that are not quite my taste. For example, the macaroni and cheese I ordered with my chicken was a little bit bland, the cornbread could have been served with more butter because it was a little bit dry for my taste, and the grilled lemon that came with the chicken was a little too bitter. But, I'm just being nitpicky. Also I didn't have them this meal but the beignets are freaking amazing. Better than Cafe Du Monde's. Get them. Also ask about them when you first order food so they can be ready in time for dessert."
Rasheeta T.,"Tallahassee, FL",11/20/2016,3.0,"Long Wait/ Food almost-greatWe waited for one hour in the cramped front section before we were seated. Others who had made reservations still had to wait as well, so be prepared for some idle time. The food, farm-fresh, was quite tasty. Just a tad bit above average but perfect for breakfast. The hash browns were definitely the star of the show. Unfortunately, our waitress was extremely rude :/ which was quite disappointing given the friendly and warm atmosphere. I'll be back for the food and will remain hopeful that other staff members are in a much better mood when I return :) 3 stars."
Lydia K.,"Spokane, WA",3/6/2016,4.0,"WARNING: If you are going to check this place out, make a reservation! There are always people waiting to get in, and it gets really crowded. Parking: I took metro to this place so not familiar with the parking. It seemed like there is no restaurant parking garage so you probably have to street park. And it seems a bit challenging to find a parking spot on week days. Food: pretty good! Only downside was that my shrimp tomato pasta was undercooked and noodles were all stuck to each other. When I asked our server it was not cooked well, he brought the same dish after waiting for about 15 mins. But this time it was a little too overcooked. Honestly I was disappointed with their pasta and I am definitely ordering something else next time. I highly do recommend tuna salad though even though it is a bit pricey (~$17). The portion was a lot bigger than I thought and it could totally been an entree instead of an appetizer. Tuna was fresh and their crackers on the side were crunchy and yummy. I also ordered deviled egg for 5 bucks and it is worth your money. I kinda wish I tried seafood deviled egg though because i am a sucker for seafood :P maybe next time! Their chicken pot pie was average in my opinion.Price: it is definitely not a cheap restaurant. Spending 70 dollars as lunch for 2 people, I find it a bit pricey. Their lunch menu varies from around 15 dollars to up to 30 dollars per entree. It was definitely a good experience that I can finally contribute something to ~7000 reviews on yelp. :DFinal experience: restaurant was very clean, organized with hip scent to it. Servers seemed very busy but still tried to remain friendly and helpful. It was a bit annoying how we still had to wait after making a reservation, but the restaurant was crazy busy so I should be understanding. I am definitely coming back when I am near next time. :)"
Monica W.,"Roseville, CA",7/14/2017,4.0,"Our waitress was amazing which made the experience so wonderful! I wish I  knew her name so that I could give her kudos. All I know is she was getting ready to take the Bar exam and she was sooo friendly and helpful! Food was good too. Not great but good. Long wait, so make reservations online ahead of time."
Jun Li Z.,"Arlington, VA",10/10/2016,5.0,Waited about 40 min for 2 seats on Sunday night. Get a reservation!Appetizer: Corn bread with honey butter - butter melted on the soft and fluffy corn bread. Entree: Chicken bolognese bucatini is the best pasta dish here. The pasta is so chewy and yummy with the sauce! I highly recommend this dish!
Ashley P.,"Indianapolis, IN",3/5/2016,5.0,Can I give this place 10 stars? Because I would if I could. I'm in town on vacation and had this place recommended from a friend of a friend. But then trusty Yelp backed up that recco and thankfully I was able to get a reservation for 2 at 7:45 on a Thursday because otherwise there would have been close to a 1.5hr wait. It was a very crowded waiting area but servers came around with samples of the most marvelous bacon I've ever had so that really made the 10 minutes we had to wait for our table pass by. (Yes even with a reservation we had a slight wait - not horrible though!) We got sat and immediately greeted with water by our server Nathan. We ordered two cocktails - both of the vodka cocktails on the menu. Deeeeliciois. And then we ordered the chicken & waffles. a staple and absolutely necessary. I got the sweet potato and green beans as my sides. Also - I mean do I sound repetitive? - delicious! We ended the meal with two glasses of cava and the house made beignets. They take about 20 minutes but SO WORTH IT. they come with three dipping sauces and the raspberry was my favorite by far. I am so glad and lucky we got in here when we did. I will recommend this to friends visit DC in the future.
mina g.,"Rohnert Park, CA",10/10/2016,5.0,This place is noisy but so didn't care the food was amazing  we had. Hi Len and waffles and I afraid to say I would order it ever time I go cuz it's that dang good juicy crispy fabulousness I have pics wished I could live here just so I could come back again and again ummmm ummmm
Zain M.,"Washington, DC",2/26/2017,5.0,"As if founding farmers needs any more reviews to talk about how wonderful it is. As long as you make a reservation, you will have the best experience here! I made a reservation for 4 people 2 weeks back and our table was ready within 5 mins of us getting there. Once we were seated, our waitress Jessica made our experience wonderful. Everything from the fresh squeezed orange juice to the pillow like beignets, (which by the way were better than the cafe du monde beignets in New Orleans) to the hangover hash and the chicken and waffles was just spectacular. I really believe this is the best brunch I've ever had. I will bring anyone who ever visits me in DC to Founding Farmers 100%!"
Thandeka M.,"Washington D.C., DC",7/3/2017,5.0,"I have three words to say about Founding Farmers:Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!Who is that you ask?THE BEST BARTENDER EVER!!Between his drinks and his smile I forgot all my woes!For those of you who don't know me i'm just a little bit extra (just a little) and I like things a certain way. Tommy listened and happily accommodated all my requests to provide the perfect cocktail and even personally delivered one to my table after I was seated! I had the clementine which is awesome if you like tequila but I am sure whatever you order Tommy will make it right!For food we had the seafood deviled eggs. The crab deviled eggs were my favorite. We had the bread with Brie and apples that was good too. I had the seafood bucatini. They use homemade pasta and it was quite tasty. My friend had a fish dish which she also enjoyed. My other friend had a salad. I like that there are so many different options.Would I go back? Sure. The food was pretty good but the drinks were exceptional! Next time I might eat at the bar..."
Jennie C.,"Cardiff, CA",7/13/2017,4.0,Best food we had in our 4 day stay in DC. Make reservation days ahead or be prepared to wait.
Tahsin A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",3/29/2017,5.0,"This was my first time eating at Founding Farmers and it was absolutely magical. Our waitress recommended the pot roast, it's served with mashed potatoes, green beans, gravy, and fried onions--heavenly! The roast is melt in your mouth good. If you get the pot roast, which I highly recommend, be sure to also get an order of cornbread, delicious combo! The service was fantastic, as an added bonus."
Gerald H.,"Hammond, LA",6/21/2017,2.0,Great atmosphere! The people beside us were great to talk to during our visit. Food was less desirable. Beer was not cold and food was Ok.
John K.,"Sebastopol, CA",3/29/2017,3.0,"While the food is really great, I'm marking it down for the experience. Some folks love a loud, crowded restaurant, but I am not one of them. I'm glad for them that it is so popular, but it made for a not enjoyable experience. Our group of 8 came on a Thursday night. The entire waiting are and all around the bar was wall to wall people. The place is so loud you can barely hear the person next to you even when they are shouting into your ear. No matter where you try to stand to be out of the way, you are being knocked and jostled by staff or patrons regularly. We arrived on time with everyone in our party at 6:45pm and was told it would just be a few minutes. Through some mixup at the front, 20 minutes later when we asked they had given the table away without calling us. We had to wait another 20 minutes for a table to leave. Because everything was so packed it wasn't possible to get a drink at the bar, never mind any appetizers to tide us over while we waited. the staff did apologize and did provide the table with some complimentary corn bread and 2 other appetizers. Our server was great and I felt bad for him, as our party was so disgruntled by the time he got us I think not everyone was very kind to him. The food was very good - cornbread was like a souffle, pepper chicken wings had an amazing sauce and I enjoyed the rainbow trout with capers. Desserts were amazing giant pieces of multi-layer cake with ice cream. The carrot cake was especially great as was the strawberry ice cream. Loved the food but the experience turned me off so much I doubt I will return."
Gerald S.,"Winterville, NC",12/27/2016,5.0,This was a rushed search trying to get breakfast. They were on the top of the list and for good reason. The bourbon French toast was my second orgasm of the day . Crab  Benedict was so good. Ok finishing my mimosa later!  PS...Oh and my man Alex was the bartender extraordinaire!
Linda T.,"Queens, NY",4/7/2016,4.0,"My friends Win C. and Caroline K. have been here before. I knew that I had to try brunch at this place based on the high reviews and high ratings. Someone that I meet during my DC trip also recommended to do brunch while in DC and said Founding Farmers was great too. I was VERY LUCKY to book a spot for bunch last minute this past Sunday morning for 11AM. My friend said to try again with the reservations since I only found an opening spot for 3PM for Sunday the previous day. We were super happy and excited once I was able to make a reservation on Opentable app.We took the metro and got off at ""Farragut West"" stop. It's a quick walk from the metro. The place already had plenty of people waiting on line for a table. So, it's HIGHLY recommended making a reservation. We just waited about 5 minutes to get our table.My friend really want to try the beignets so we ordered it. It comes in 6 pieces with 3 different sauces (i.e. chocolate, raspberry, and caramel). It was really good and so fluffy! Three beignets were enough for me to eat. Then, I ordered the crab benedict with leek hash browns. I thought that the crab was salty. My friend try some of the crab and she also agreed with me that it was a bit salty.Service was fine and they didn't rush us to leave. I would love to come back one day to try the red velvet pancakes or another eggs benedict dish. :)"
Bryan L.,"Macomb, MI",4/6/2017,3.0,Drinks were amazing.  Food was average.  If we are in the area again we will stop on again for sure.  Lots of things look good on the menu.  We may have misordered.
Sarah G.,"Fort Washington, MD",3/28/2017,5.0,"The wait was long but was well worth it. We had friends coming from out of town and we chose this restaurant to kind of show them around, we were so glad we did because it had great atmosphere, great food, shared by great people. The food were organic and local farmed."
Kendal Ann M.,"Charlotte, NC",2/19/2016,4.0,"Woah, baby. I brunch'd, I saw, I conquered! I am so happy I waited this long to come to Founding Farmers. I've lived in DC for 5 years and my first (real) time here was last weekend.My first time here was for a walk in and I left immediately because they don't have happy hour, who does that? On my second attempt, I went for brunch with 12 of my closest friends. We made a reservation far in advance and it was for 12:45pm we figured this would give us a little downtime and a quieter atmosphere--WRONG. This place was PACKED even when we left at 3pm.I had my hesitations with coming to Founding Farmers but, boy, was I proven wrong! Not only did we get to sit right away, we were upstairs and our waiter took great care of us. Upon sitting down, he was practically waiting to greet us, took our drink orders. With a big party, it's not rare that someone's order is messed up, but not here.I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes and the Leek hash browns because how interesting do those sound? Are they leeks chopped up like hash browns or are there just some leeks tossed into the hash browns? I needed to know more about these! When my food came I was pleasantly surprised, as I am sure my photo will do justice!  There was the perfect flavor in every bite and the best part was no syrup was needed. Back to our service, it was just so good. Never was my glass empty. When the checks came the waiter even split them up because he saw we were trying to split the bill. That's what I call great service.I'm excited to come back here for dinner to try a few items I had my eye on. The menu is a little overwhelming, my suggestion would be to check it out before making your way to the estabalishment."
Anu K.,"Manhattan, NY",4/4/2016,4.0,"Whenever we visit DC, this is a place we really try not to miss - and you shouldn't either! Especially if you're a fan of just really good food prepared well with local ingredients -- its worth the trip (and making advance reservations!) Try to make reservations if you can.  If not, be prepared to wait... or if you go in a small group (no more than 3),  usually you can snag a seat at the full service bar. What we ordered: Skillet Cornbread - Comes with sea salted honey butter.  The cornbread in itself is so just so good... buttery, soft -  but with the sea salted honey butter?! a whole different ball game.  GET THISFried Green Tomatoes - green tomatoes have an entirely different taste form the red ones.  Which is what makes this stand out.  Really hard NOT to like a fried dish, but the sauces that it comes with are the real standouts!! Yankee Pot Roast - Oh so good! If you're in the mood for something hearty.. GET THIS!! Everything in this dish complements very well.  From the vegetables, to the gravy and the mashed potatoes - GET THIS! Chicken and Waffles - Chicken is really great, but the standout are the waffles.   Normally I'm not overly crazy about waffles -- I just feel so heavy afterwards.. but these waffles are so light and airy and are so fun to eat! GET THIS!!We were so full that we had absolutely no room for desert.  Looking forward to trying other dishes!"
Jess M.,"Madison, WI",7/19/2017,5.0,The only bad thing about this place is trying to choose from all the amazing menu options. The chicken pot pie was phenomenal. A wonderful atmosphere and even better service from our waiter Marc! Will definitely be paying this place another visit.
Maj H.,"San Jose, CA",6/25/2017,3.0,"I read really good reviews about this restaurant and was super excited to try it.  Reservations was sparse, but I was able to reserve an early dinner slot.  There was an exorbitant amount of people waiting for tables at 5:00pm and even more so when we left at 6:30pm.  None of what we ordered, seafood deviled egg combo, shrimp grits and andouille, Farmhouse platter, sea and land, crab cakes, and cedar plank salmon were to die for.  The food was okay.   The bacon lollis, the milk shake, and chocolate ice cream were good though. Maybe the chefs were having an off day??"
Gemma K.,"New York, NY",7/5/2017,4.0,"This is my second time here and boy this place does not disappoint, the food was phenomenal and the service was kind, I would give this place 5 stars if it was not for the African American hostess Shontae in the pant suit and bob weave who greeted us as if there was a death in her family.  She then proceeded to seat the five of us in a tiny corner booth fit for 4 ppl on the second floor in the half empty restaurant, after we were seated and realize there was no way the food we were going to order was going to fit on the table, she walked away and came back fuming and grabbed all our menus and stormed off to seat us on the lower level.  Not only is this appalling, but to be a hostess, the first person who customers are greeted by, is absolutely unacceptable for any type of food establishment."
Elvin H.,"Lexington, KY",10/1/2016,4.0,"Excellent menu with great tasting comfort food beautifully presented. Unfortunately the service is inconsistent and the environment comes across as pretentious from the staff. The pot roast was perfectly flavored with generous potatoes. The iced tea tasted different and was good, but our server didn't know why. There are no free refills on iced tea, and it takes about 10 minutes to get a glass. I have no idea why. I'm giving them 4 stars based on food. I would definitely return, but I'd hope the service issues were resolved."
Anna P.,"Tampa, FL",7/28/2017,5.0,Really amazing food and great prices. Definitely get the pork chop because it was huge and very juicy! The best pork I've ever had. You can tell everything is very fresh and well made. The donuts were really good too! I don't usually write reviews but this place was amazing so I highly recommend it. Really awesome homemade pasta too.
Allie B.,"Fort Knox, KY",7/19/2017,5.0,"So good! I had the goat cheese ravioli, and I dreamed about it for days afterward. I can't wait to go back."
Trent M.,"Aptos, CA",5/6/2017,5.0,"Outstanding. It was a hot day in DC and my son and I took an uber from the Lincoln Memorial to Founders because it was #1 nearby. So glad we did. It was super packed, but we got a table right upstairs immediately. My son talks about this meal weeks later. Said it was the best burger he has ever had, and we have several amazing burgers here in Santa Cruz, CA. After your meal, have a desert even if there's no room for more (posted a pic of desert menu)!"
Alicia M.,"Washington, DC",7/5/2017,4.0,"Even though we had 2:45 pm reservation, we still had to wait approx 15 min, everything else was good. Really liked the corn bread and crab dip appetizer"
Tala H.,"Kalamazoo, MI",3/26/2017,4.0,"We went there for late lunch around 3:30, it was busy and I have been told that you cannot go there with no reservation. The farmer's salad is a must order! It was delicious and had a variety of ingredients. The corn bread was good for an appetizer as well. For the main dish, we had the Mexican plate and it was YUM YUM! Definitely a must if you are visiting DC and worth the wait!"
John L.,"Wallingford, CT",3/13/2017,5.0,Earned every star!! A MUST!! Go! Make reservations ASAP!! Very hard to get in because it Awesome.
Larry K.,"Dayton, OH",6/15/2017,3.0,"If going to this restaurant be prepared to possibly wait 1.5 hours to get a table. Once you are in you'll find the decor nice. The seating arrangements are okay, but I felt a bit snug with 4 other people. The menus are sort of large which can end up hitting someone in the face. I'd recommend a smaller sized menu. The menu options are great. I had the prime rib, which was okay. I have had better at places such as Ocharleys or J. Alexanders. The mashed potatoes and green beans were delicious. It was an okay restaurant and I can see myself possible going back if in the area but nothing to die for."
Pamela D.,"Washington, DC",6/14/2017,4.0,I visited Founding Farmers for brunch during the Spring and the food was really good. The service was a little slow due to the place being extrememly crowded but i didn't mind the wait when the chicken and waffles i ordered were nothing short of delicious. I'd def choose this one over Farmers Fishers Bakers any day. I'd recommend calling ahead for reservations since the wait can get pretty lengthy.
Paul V.,"Kennesaw, GA",5/5/2017,5.0,"Three words: they have beignets.  Okay most of you can stop reading now and head on over!  Still reading?  They also have carbs--but don't worry they're all good carbs.  The pancakes, the waffles, the beignets....  I've only eaten breakfast here, but each time it was great.  I've eaten at the bar and at tables, with equally good service both places.  I imagine the thick-cut bacon was hand-carved from a local pig just for my arrival because it's so flavorful and crispy.  Even the eggs were--well the eggs were fine, but they're eggs so don't blame them.  I'll return when I can, and leave with some beignets."
Lindsay N.,"Buffalo, NY",8/25/2016,4.0,"We showed up here at 11:30 on Thursday and it was already bumping with the business lunch crowd. Despite not having a reservation, they seated us at a communal table and warned us it was reserved in an hour. While we waited for our server, we looked around at all of the food...everything looked mouth- watering amazing. While we were at first bummed that we missed breakfast (it ends at 11), there was no way we were leaving. So, we ordered lunch instead. My husband got the chicken pot pie, which was creamy, comforting and seasoned perfectly-- you know, just what you're going for on a ninety degree DC afternoon. I tried the shrimp and grits, which were absolutely amazing. The seasoning was perfect and there were plenty of shrimp andouille to enjoy--which isn't usually the case with this dish.The only reason this review gets four stars is because our server was not really attentive and was particularly dour when she was around. I know it's busy, blah blah all that, but I also wanted to order a bloody Mary but she never passed our table again until we were well into our food. I get it. I worked in food service, I work now in customer service. Some days you just can't bring yourself to get into it and there's nothing you can do. Other than that, if you love good food and are in DC you need to plan to stop here. It's totally worth it."
Mel M.,"Norcross, GA",1/17/2017,5.0,"My first time here and I absolutely love this place. The menu had a lot of variety and it was hard to choose. I finally settled on shrimp and grits and the cornbread. Our waitress was attentive, quick, and polite. We didn't have to wait long for our food. Despite the mixed reviews I had an awesome experience here. I will definitely be back."
Abe H.,"San Marcos, CA",6/30/2017,5.0,"What a great place to enjoy a meal with the family. We had the crab Eggs Benedict, carrot cake pancakes, and more! All was amazing, service was great, very nice people and helpful."
Carol C.,"Boston, MA",9/6/2016,3.0,"I came here while on a birthday trip with my mom. Before we left for DC, I went on Yelp and browsed the most reviewed, highest rated restaurants to see where I wanted to go for my birthday meal. Based on the reviews and pictures of the food here, I immediately made a reservation.On a weekday night, restaurant was grossly crowded and the food tasted pretty standard. Maybe all the positive reviews gave me unrealistic expectations of this place. We ordered: fried green tomatoes, chicken pot pie, and chicken and waffles. The fried green tomatoes were the best part of the meal because they were perfectly crispy. The chicken pot pie was lacking in seasoning and the fried chicken was standard. The waffles were good though. I expected the food to be amazing considering the number of people who were there. But maybe they were all riding the hype train?Overall, the food was good and the portions were huge. The service was nice, but the restaurant was way too crowded to make the meal enjoyable."
Julie P.,"Manhattan, NY",8/27/2016,5.0,"Literally sitting at the bar at Founding Farmers and writing this review! My friend and I came here (from NYC, aka food mecca) to see why 8,000 Yelp reviewers loved this place.Hands down THE BEST brunch I've ever had. I ordered their crab benedict: I'm actually one of those people that will eat everything except the English muffin, thus the crab was a bit salty but when I took a bite with the muffin, flavor was perfect. I also ordered their corn bread: see picture!!! SO MUCH FRESH CORN IN MA' BREAD! The salted butter was delish. My friend and I shared their devilish egg (seafood combo) and my two favs were the lobster and crab (also came with classic and salmon). She ordered a shrimp pasta with sun dried tomatoes and I may have stolen a bite or two or three or four. The pasta had to have been hand pressed and kneaded all night by the chef himself and then lathered with love because they were so chewy. I don't know what kind of crack they put into the sauce but something is def in there.She also ordered an ahi tuna salad and she finished the bowl. Yes..... We ate a ton of food. But honestly, there have been plenty of places where I'd eaten just a plate of food and felt so gross afterwards because of the msg, poor quality of flour, poor seasoning and too much salt but my friend and I left here feeling very content. And now we are fully energized to visit the Smithsonian!"
Dana H.,"Long Beach, CA",4/7/2017,1.0,"I was going to give this place three stars for mediocre breakfast food you could get anywhere...that is until my husband almost ate a rotten tomato. Over priced, over hyped and not all that great.  We ordered eggs over medium; the whites were crispy and the yolk was overly runny, they were also very over seasoned with salt.. I couldn't even finish mine because of the salt. Bacon was soggy, seasonal fruit was not seasonal which is OK except what I got was half not fresh and half not ripe. I would never recommend anybody waste their time and money here, at least not for breakfast."
Stephanie C.,"Boston, MA",3/29/2016,5.0,"I have so much love for Founding Farmers. First of all, it's so cool that they serve organic food and are co-owned by 40,000 family farms. Second of all...the food. Oh my god, the food is AMAZING. It's simple but so perfectly cooked that I can't even think of how it could possibly be improved. And the restaurant itself is pretty cool too - check out the restrooms which have fun tokens of wisdom from the  olden days scrawled across the walls.Here's what I tried (shared between 2 people, just so you know I'm not a huge fatty):- chicken pot pie: this was the BEST. It totally blows Marie Calendar's out of the water. Tender, tender strips of chicken, a fluffy biscuit, and the most thick, creamy, cheesy, delicious soup- Yankee pot roast: mashed potatoes, succulent gravy, fall-apart tender beef, and perfectly cooked roast veggies make a hearty and lip-smacking combo - fried green tomatoes: this was a unique dish. The tomatoes stood up well to frying and had a mild sour flavor that went well with the two delicious sauces. They're also quite big, so this is a hearty appetizer! - devilish eggs: you're thinking deviled eggs can't really be that good, but these were something else. It's just like a really, really well-made egg salad spooned back into the whites - carrot cake: this was also amaaaaaaazing. So moist and yummy with  a silky smooth cream cheese frosting that wasn't cloyingly sweet. It just might be the best carrot cake I've ever had!"
Em A.,"New York, NY",7/9/2017,5.0,A wonderful dining experience. Terrell was very friendly and made our dinner perfect. Will be coming back
Ran B.,"Raleigh, NC",8/22/2017,4.0,"Not as good as my expectation. The quality of food is good, but not the service. I was treated not friendly, nor happily."
Kristine P.,"Hubbard, IA",8/31/2017,5.0,"Absolutely loved the food at Founding Farmers in Washington DC. So fresh and delicious. Coming from a farming family, I appreciated it even more knowing that they care so much about the food that is made there. Our server was very helpful and kind. I had a mint limeade to drink that was so refreshing and the chicken &a waffles paired with macaroni and cheese and garden green beans. My husband had the pork loin sandwich and their house beer which he loved. Nothing but good things to say. I thought the prices were fair as well based on the quality."
Kara L.,"Kansas City, MO",5/2/2017,3.0,"The great: all of the food was delish! We had the popcorn and breads to start, and I had the goat cheese ravioli. The good: service was friendly and attentive, bathroom was clean, and drinks were solid.The annoying: everything is pretty pretentious, and we had to wait despite having reservations. The bad: lord almighty it is loud inside and everyone waiting in the entrance/bar is jammed in like sardines."
Nicholas R.,"Scarsdale, NY",7/16/2017,5.0,Stuffed myself silly there with the high quality and good-sized portions. Always a great spot to go when I visit DC.
Jackson L.,"San Jose, CA",8/15/2016,4.0,"Founding Farmers was on our must eat list for DC-- I heard about their cookbook multiple times and received many recommendations from friends about menu items!Reservations were not available at desirable times during our short trip to DC, so we decided to take our chances at 3 PM on a Saturday afternoon.The hostess/host team quoted 40 minutes, but asked us to return in 25 just in case. We got a coffee across the street and came back 20 minutes later, only to be told that they had already called our name. Lesson learned-- stay nearby if they don't take your cell number for texting! Fortunately, they found a table for us.Service was friendly by our waiter, although he did disappear at times. My friends loved the deviled eggs, and I enjoyed the fried green tomatoes.The turkey sandwich entree was quite tasty-- and something I wish I would see more often! Freshly roasted, thick, and juicy white meat with some dark meat thrown in for good measure. I requested cheddar cheese instead of whatever came with it, and the sandwich was just a tad too dry. I really liked the top texture of the bread!The cedar plank salmon is also delicious! The fillet and cedar plank is covered in a glaze-- but it was tangy and warm!In terms of sides.... The watermelon is delicious (if you get a well-mixed batch). Mine was great, while other portions at our table had little mint and seasoning....The cucumber/pea side was refreshing although somewhat bland.We waited quite a bit for the check at the end, but overall, this was a good dinning experience. I'm not sure I would return on a regular basis if I lived in the area, as braving the crowds could be overwhelming!"

Updated review",3.0,"Third times not a charm, ordered the 8oz filet medium. The first one came out well done, sent it back and the next one came out rare (barely). Just see the photos of the barely eaten steak."
Kyle O.,"San Diego, CA",10/16/2016,2.0,"Glorified Cheesecake Factory... I don't get the hype but apparently the 8,000 other people that reviewed this place on Yelp feel otherwise.The good:-cocktails are creative and tasty -friendly people-cool ambiance The bad:-waited 15 minutes for our table even though we were slightly early for reservation. -somewhat noticeable smell of the carpet -waiter dropped our drinks. No biggie. Then he dropped a knife on my shoe and then proceeded to compliment my shoe when picking up the knife. Kinda odd.The ugly:-food is over salted and presentation is lackluster -never offered or brought plates to share apps (couldn't find waiter to ask)-when food was brought out one of the sides was wrong. Normally not a problem except the food runner wasn't fluent in English nor did he offer to get our waiter"
Ro N.,"New York, NY",3/27/2017,3.0,"A bunch of came here and I don't get it, what's up with the hype around their food? There were six of us, and we had no reservations, so the wait time was 2 hours and we came here and we all just didn't understand what is so fantastic about this place?Beignet - this was good and only with the raspberry sauce, but the chocolate dipping sauce was very heavy and I didn't think of it particularly as a good dipping consistency, and the caramel was just okay.I had the Sausage and Gravy Benedict and I thought it was a bit on the saltier side and the white gravy didn't bring back any memories for me when I had really good white gravy.A had the Banana Foster Waffle and A thought it was a true waffle, since the texture was more of a pancake and so did S who got the Chicken and Waffles and thought it wasn't a true waffle.S had the Hangover Hash and whomp whomp - so we ordered a variety of things and the only thing I could walk away with is the Uncle Buck's Beignet were decent, but is it worth the 2 hour long wait?Obviously, that is a no....I expected more....a lot more, if there were tons of people waiting to eat at 9:30 am in the morning."
Leslie S.,"New York, NY",4/18/2017,4.0,We went on Easter Sunday for a late breakfast and found seats at the bar. The eggs benedict and roasted vegetable scramble were both very good! The hash browns were also very good! The food is reasonably priced for what you get. I would recommend this place for breakfast based on our experience!
Jesabelle D.,"Silver Spring, MD",4/18/2017,5.0,"I'm a fan of all Founding Farmers! This location tends to fill really quickly and even with a reservation, there's always a wait (30 mins both times). I guess it beats the 1 1/2 hour wait when we didn't have a reservation. Now to the food....*The deviled eggs are amazing!!*The crab cakes are superior!!*The salmon, I can eat everyday! *The cauliflower steak, interesting! *The ribs and crunchy shrimp, we love! *The green beans and the cabbage/kale/pear combo, I love! Love the decor here and the patio they offer at their Rockville location (we are going this week)!!Keep up the good work and the amazing food!"
Liz M.,"Chicago, IL",5/13/2017,5.0,"This is my favorite place to eat in DC thus far. The chicken and waffles are a great option, BUT the Steak and Enchiladas is really where its at with some cornbread and fried tomatoes on the side. Always a go to and never disappointed. The desert menu is great as well esp if you love cheesecake or chocolate cake (its huge; can share with 3 ppl)."
Svetlana M.,"Cupertino, CA",8/27/2016,4.0,"Pros: Decent prices and portions, delicious beignets, and funky drinks. Also a very clean building located not far from the metro station (Farragut West)Cons: Limited menu, cinnamon in their maple syrup,    Confusing opening times. First of all, we wanted to grab Saturday Brunch here around 11-maybe 12. When we went to reserve a table, the only spot available was 8:45AM. We thought about it, and decided we could just make it breakfast. Honestly, it was a breakfast menu-not a brunch one- so it worked well. However, if you do want to come later, reserve earlier! So we come to the restaurant at 8:25, thinking they might take us in. They were not open, and opening time was said to be 9AM. We were thoroughly confused, fortunately, they started to let people in around 8:40. Even that early in the morning there were quite a lot of people. The restaurant has two floors- both of which are nice and clean, maybe slightly dark. The best food we ordered? I really loved the beignets. They seemed too dense or too creamy to some, but I found them delicious and fluffy.  They were big and numerous (more than enough for 4 people). My friend ordered the chicken and waffles. She enjoyed the chicken and then made me split the waffle with her. Unfortunately she is allergic to cinnamon and ALL of their maple syrup was infused with cinnamon. They offered many other condiments, but waffles without maple syrup are somewhat sad. I had the roasted vegetable scramble. It was slightly bland but after adding a bit of Tabasco and salt- it was much better. I had it with a crisp English muffing and seasonal fruit. For their drinks- unfortunately they were not serving their espresso drinks. We had their French press. I was pleasantly surprised by its smoothness. We also ordered one of their drinks  that included seltzer water, egg cream, and chocolate syrup. If you like root beer floats- this drink is for you. If not (unfortunately me)- than maybe skip it and order something else."
Sue H.,"Baltimore, MD",9/17/2016,4.0,"Excellent dinner of veggies meatloaf (outstanding) and scallops with butternut risotto (perfection). Well priced and definitely one of the trendy restaurants. Only issue was the server, who was MIA too often. Nice and knowledgeable, but just didn't come by the table nearly enough."
Kim W.,"Manhattan, NY",8/26/2017,5.0,"Had an amazing dinner here. Although I'm not from the area, if I come back, I will definitely make a point to return. We had the corn bread, chicken and and waffles, and spicy crab dip - all of the dishes were delicious, but the most amazing was the corn bread by far."
Mika D.,"West Babylon, NY",7/14/2017,5.0,The brunch was so great we went back twice. Service was super wonderful. Food was good and hot and the vibe was nice. Would definitely return. Baked goods were fresh.
Sam A.,"San Francisco, CA",9/16/2016,4.0,This seems like the place to be these days. Walked in with a coworker on a Wednesday evening and the wait was over an hour. Luckily we were able to snag a spot at the bar. The menu was amazing and I kind of wish I ordered something else...I went with the grilled ribeye and it came out more like prime rib. Soft texture without grill marks and without the fat rendered off. It was good but just not exactly what I was craving. Would definitely try again when I'm in town. You can tell they do real deal food.
Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",9/16/2016,5.0,I have nothing but praises to speak about this place! It's been on my Yelp bookmarks for over a year and I finally made it in on Labor day for brunch with my family. We got there and it was packed and the host originally quoted us about 2 hours. Determined to finally see what the hype was about we decided to wait. It ended up only taking an hour but it was well worth the wait. Everything we ate and drank was absolutely delicious! I tried the strawberry and champagne drink off the brunch menu it was great. Then I ordered the waffle with strawberries. My family got the French toast and red velvet pancakes both were awesome including my daughters chicken fingers that were perfectly seasoned. Needless to say I don't think it will take another year for me to get back!
Gina C.,"Manhattan, NY",3/19/2016,5.0,"So good that we ate at Founding Farmers for dinner and made reservations for breakfast the next day on our way out. For dinner we had: the prosciutto and brie farm breads ($9 each), the butternut squash mascarpone ravioli, and the diver scallops meunière with butternut squash risotto.For brunch the next day: red velvet pancakes, chicken and waffles, and the founding farmers breakfast. Definitely recommend getting a farm bread for the table to share if you're going for lunch or dinner. The dinner menu items were more unique, but definitely a lot more decadent. As for the brunch, you can imagine typical breakfast/brunch items, but at a much higher caliber because their ingredients that they utilize are super fresh and clean."
Linda C.,"Manhattan, NY",4/16/2017,5.0,"This place is awesome. The portions are a good size and has a hip, popping vibe. It's by a college campus, so will be full of young people. We got the following which ended up being way too much food for two people. If we came back we would probably pass on the appetizers and just go with the entrees which were both absolutely delicious. The serving sizes were good. Appetizers: Skillet Corn Bread Glazed Bacon LollisEntrees: Lobster Mac & Cheese Shrimp & Grits Andouille"
Howie H.,"Caldwell, NJ",8/6/2016,5.0,"Great food and great service. We ordered the fried chicken and waffle and the cured ham. Both delicious. The waffle was light and airy.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The chicken had ""extra fiber"" in it but the staff fixed that right away.  They don't have decaf coffee, but they made a decaf expresso and turned that into a decaf coffee and it was fantastic.  Did I say the staff is very attentive and great? Real talk."
Denise S.,"Odessa, TX",4/27/2017,4.0,Make reservations ahead of time! The food was big portions! I highly recommend the skillet corn bread with the butter and honey. The meatloaf was really good until I cut in the middle then it was raw meat!
Marko E.,"Budd Lake, Mount Olive Township, NJ",1/2/2017,4.0,"I like this place, its busy for a reason, food is very good. I recommend making reservations. I wanted to give this place a 5 but someone didn't know how to cook a medium rare steak. All is forgiven though because they got me a new dish. Beignet: 10/10  (recommend this)- Dip it with caramel....... omg!- Presentation was nice lookingWaffle chicken: 10/10- Not like Waffel House but damn good still- Nice presentation.Steak and eggs: 10/10- Great portion size"
SuperMarrio P.,"Washington, DC",7/22/2017,3.0,"Although this place always seems to have a large group always gathered in the waiting area, I am not really impressed with them. I found that the food was lacking in presentation and taste. I dont really care for the seating and space and on my visit the wait was long."
Maria A.,"Arlington, VA",9/12/2016,5.0,"Farmhouse Platter was not that good, chili was dry, hotdog was undercooked, red potatoes were sweet.  However, the corn was AMAZING!  I would definitely recommend the chicken and waffles with green beans!!"
Jessica W.,"Sacramento, CA",9/12/2016,5.0,"Not the most delicious food in the world BUTTTTTTTTTTTTT FIVE STARS OVERALL!!! I admit that the food isn't anything crazy special. Is it bad? Definitely not. Delicious to the point where I have dreams about it? No. But the food here is good. Everything tastes fresh, is presented nicely, shows care, and is EXTREMELY affordable. The amount of food and quality of food you get for the price alone is a great reason to come here. You'll definitely leave satisfied. I had the French toast which could be shared with 2 people and it was yummy with strawberries and filling. I did crave something savory afterwards. Luckily my brother ordered the chicken and waffles. Also good! The chicken reminds me of chic-fil-a chicken (which is bomb) which is a compliment but I still expected a little more from a restaurant. But for the price? Can't beat it. The menu is also fairly large so there is something on it for everyone. Even for the vegetarians out there! Ambiance is also incredibly beautiful. Two stories so plenty of seating, but make a reservation if you can because it gets packed. The attention to detail is definitely there. From the table layout and lights to adding a cinnamon stick to the maple syrup. Highly recommended and will return if I visit the DC area again."
Lauren M.,"London, United Kingdom",9/11/2016,4.0,"We came here for brunch on a recent trip to DC. Arrived on time and were seated straight away in a nice booth. The restaurant was packed and there were lots of people waiting for tables so obviously this is a popular spot so glad we had booked in advance!Two of us had the original eggs benedicts and, other than the eggs being slightly undercooked (I don't really like it when the whites are runny) they were good. The other two in our party were disappointed to learn the restaurant had not got its delivery of crab that day so they were unable to have the crab benedicts so both settled for one of the salads which they both enjoyed.Overall, a good brunch spot. Service was efficient and we all enjoyed our time here and would return if I found myself down in DC again."
Lisa K.,"Cebu City, Philippines",4/14/2017,4.0,"This place was really cute and love the ""farm to table"" theme. But they took a long time to seat us when we had made a reservation and showed up on time, saying ""our 8:30s are just finishing"". So they need to manage their reservation system better.Once we got a seat, the server was friendly and everything was yummy - although the eggs Florentine could have come out hotter.The mimosas were so good made with fresh squeezed OJ that had clearly been squeezed right into the glass."
Kevin Z.,"Fairfax, VA",3/13/2016,4.0,"This is my second time coming here for their lunch menu.  I had an awesome time on both occasions!Farm Bread:  Crisp Apple Brie - Can't go wrong with this.Starter: Fried Green Tomatoes - This is a crowd favorite and I can see why.  The crunchy outside layer of the tomatoes adds that extra kick to the texture.  Plus, it's healthy (I mean its: green [Check], and Vegetable [Check] can't get better than that).Entrees: Chicken Pot Pie -  This is amazing.  One of those comfort foods that you can eat and continue to eat until your stomach says no more.  They serve in rather large portions, so don't worry if you have a big appetite, your stomach will thank you if you come hungry!Chicken & Waffles - This dish have over 1000 reviews (Holy cow!).  The waffles are amazing.  The taste is between a combination of crispy and fluffy.  Spicy Ahi Tuna Poke - We got this to go and it was okay.  Perhaps we waited too long to eat it later during that day.  It was a newer item that I haven't seen from my previous visit.The staff was fast to service our needs. Tip: Make sure to reserve your table ahead of time!  You don't want to be on that wait list (Your stomach will hate you, matter of fact the future you will hate you for not booking ahead of time!)- Also you can find paid street parking outside of the restaurant but it's probably best to metro in."
Toni J.,"Washington, DC",2/3/2016,5.0,Good food and great atmosphere.Came here for my birthday dinner with a friend. We had a reservation for 5:45pm and were seated promptly.The waiter was attentive and the food was heavenly. I'm definitely coming back here for any celebrations. It's so close to work and the metro stops!!Would recommend this to anyone and I'll definitely be back!
Lyndi K.,"Sergeant Bluff, IA",4/25/2017,4.0,"We stopped in for breakfast on a weekday morning after making a last-minute reservation and were delighted to be seated quickly. The breakfast menu offered plenty of sweets, some heartier options, and a wide variety of drinks as well. Our food came in a reasonable amount of time, and it was DELICIOUS!! Specifically, the Bananas Foster Stuffed French Toast was absolutely divine and the Roasted Vegetable Scramble was superb as well. This place is a DC original serving up some scrumptious stuff."
CS W.,"Oakland, CA",3/20/2017,5.0,"This is the legitest place I've been to in D.C. Granted, I've only lived here six months. And I don't get out much. And, with the exception of like four weeks, the weather is either too hot or too cold. And D.C. streets are really filthy, so I dread going outside of my neighborhood (y'all ever heard of hosing down the sidewalks?). But, if I have friends coming in from out of town, and I want to pretend like I'm fancy, and I'm not going to Busboys and Poets or Rasika, this is the place. The wait is long, so make a reservation. And even with a reservation, the wait is long. The brunch is good. But, the dinner is even better. It's vegetarian-friendly enough and the prices are high but not outrageous. And this place has real servers pretending to be nice. Not like most restaurants in D.C. where the servers couldn't care less if you feel welcomed or satisfied. Definitely check out this place. It's trendy, without being touristy and classy without being too upscale. But, you'll also be comfortable dressed casually."
Shenique B.,"Salisbury, MD",7/24/2016,3.0,"Great food, okay service.We came in for a late lunch and after an hour long wait we were seated in a tight corner about 2cm from another table. Very uncomfortable. The water they served was room temperature at best and tasted like tap water. The food was tasty. Definitely try the chicken and waffles and the sampler. A lot of food for your money. The dessert stole the show. Best red velvet cake I've had!"
Emma W.,"Bay Village, OH",7/30/2016,5.0,"MAKE RESERVATIONS!!!! Especially if it's a weekend. This place is number 1 on Yelp breakfast places and everyone wants to come here. There's always a wait on weekend mornings.What a great breakfast place. Very cozy, friendly staff, fresh food. My sisters and I came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning for our 9:30am reservation. We were seated within 5 minutes and taken upstairs to a cozy booth. Their coffee is so good. Fresh and strong. We all got variations of the founding farmers breakfast. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the toast with jam was awesome. The jam had small chunks of strawberries in it which I loved. The hash browns were nothing special. Just hash browns but who doesn't love those? Overall, it was a great experience."
Emma N.,"Washington, DC",5/7/2017,3.0,"I have been here for dinner and brunch. Pros: lots of options, especially for dinner. Cocktails are good.Cons: I didn't like their brunch, overall their food is solid but not amazing and for the prices they charge I believe there are better spots in DC to eat."
Octavia Daenerys E.,"Tewksbury, MA",9/4/2016,4.0,"Had breakfast here and was amazed at the quality of the food! Wasn't too keen on the 30 minute wait but hey that's life and it is understandable! Started off with an ""appetizer"" which were (im told) French donuts with sauce (chocolate, raspberry and caramel) holy were they ever amazing! Then finished off with the stuffed French toast bananas foster!Admittedly when they brought it out I thought no way was this going to fill me up! I was going to leave hungry....nope so wrong! I couldn't even finish it all! I wanted to because it was so delicious but I was stuffed! Definitely worth a trip to eat here! Be patient because everyone else deserves their turn to eat too, but worth the wait for sure!"
Amir N.,"San Francisco, CA",7/2/2017,2.0,Very very regular brunch here! Still dont know why it is this famous and everybody is crazy about it
Meredith V.,"Alexandria, VA",1/12/2016,3.0,"What a lot of hype this place has had! I've been wanting to check out this downtown location for years and finally had the opportunity....on New Years Eve! Perhaps not the best time to test quality control, but the dinner was long overdue.Seating is pretty intimate, you'll be dining very close to other patrons. We noticed service was particularly slow, drinks took a long time all night, as well as water refills and just flagging down our server in general. This played a large role in our overall feeling of the place, as we kept waiting for our drinks. We noticed A LOT of children dining here, as well as very casual attire, suggesting this to be on par with a place like Outback; price point is similar to Outback as well. We ordered a couple cocktails that, for $14, were a little overpriced, in my opinion. We started with the blue cheese bacon dates, that were VERY date-forward; barely tasted any blue cheese, far too sweet. I went with the fresh catch, Sea Bass, in meuniere style with a side salad, because the etoufee (or whatever salad mix was on the menu) had sold out. My bf ordered the pork chop w/ sides of green beans and red whipped potatoes. Both entrees and sides were good and flavorful but left a bit to be desired. My point is it wasn't this AMAZING place that it had been made out to be. I think they have an incredibly interesting menu and that will not be trivialized, but the food didn't necessarily blow me away, nor did the service. I do look forward to returning, especially because it's not too expensive of a place and it has an ever-changing seasonal menu. I also think service may have been a fluke that night because it was New Years Eve so for that, it deserves a second chance. For now, it's a solid 3 stars."
Alissa N.,"Bloomfield, NJ",4/10/2017,2.0,"After hearing lots talk about Founding Farmers, my husband and I made reservations for breakfast. We were seated quickly but it took our server over 10 minutes to come to our table. He did not bring us water at that time. After being seated for 15 minutes, our waiter returned with water and took our order for drinks and food. We also noticed small brown particles in our water jug and kindly asked for a new one. He returned with a new water jug but did not take our glasses which were filled with the water from the previous jug. Our food arrived before our drinks.    A few minutes after the food arrived he brought my husband his OJ but forgot my coffee. So for 20-25 minutes, we sat at a table with no beverages. The food was good and we really enjoyed it. The service however was not very good. He was not very apologetic either. If the service improved this place would be great!"
Michelle M.,"Las Vegas, NV",5/26/2017,3.0,"Just meh, from entree to desert. Shrimp and grits ok, bbq pork ribs ok, waffle chicken ok and stew was the best. For $140 not really worth it."
Betsy B.,"Derry, NH",7/1/2017,4.0,"Started out with a classic cocktail, a Coctel Algeria made with Pisco. Delicious! Dinner was their signature chicken & waffles with their macaroni and cheese and I subbed the honey scotch carrots for my veg. A very good rendition of a southern classic. I think there is always a wait here; we waited for quite a while even with reservations, but the food is worth the wait. The servers are knowledgeable and happy to make suggestions, and we never felt rushed."
Aaliyah H.,"Minneapolis, MN",4/9/2017,5.0,Such a cool spot. Super trendy. And everything is made from scratch. One of my fav spots in DC
Laura H.,"Washington, DC",8/31/2016,5.0,"Usually if a place is super busy, I'm unable to enjoy it. Founding farmers is a huge exception though. The wait, the crowds, it is all worth it for this wonderful place. I really enjoyed having the Constitution drink the last time I was there. The cauliflower steak was incredible as a main. Then for dessert the beignets were worth ordering 25 minutes early. Easily one of my favorite places in DC despite the crowds."
Bob N.,"Tucson, AZ",1/23/2017,5.0,"Simply put...Thomas (Tommy) gave the best customer service (he's in the bar area) and the breakfast was Amazing! Go here for midtown breakfast! Bob and Edith's diner is good too, but in Arlington."
Bianca L.,"Washington, DC",1/30/2017,1.0,"My sister and I came here last night to celebrate her birthday. I noted on our reservation that is was her birthday, I told the hostess that sat us that it was her birthday and I also let our server know. We went to the bar to grab a drink while we waited for our seats. She asked for champagne. When the unfriendly bartender finally greeted us, I asked for a ""champagne split"". He said ""what do you mean split, what is that?"" and I said ""a glass"". He proceeded ""oh we don't do that"". So we ordered something else. I then saw him pour the gentleman next to us a glass of bubbly. Nice. We had dinner at a tiny table for two tucked away upstairs. Our server was unremarkable. He said ""Happy Birthday"" to my sister as he presented the check. He was new and suggested a flat bread that was pretty tasty. Overall, food was good, atmosphere was jumping but hospitality left much to be desired."
Deyni M.,"New Brunswick, NJ",11/20/2016,2.0,"It was OK. From my experience it seems overrated. And extremely overpriced. Maybe we ordered the wrong things. I had the ribeye and I was over cooked. They replaced it and it was ok. The sides were green beans and red potatoes and, again they were just average. My boyfriend ordered chicken bolognese bucatini, and it was alright too. The bacon lollies we had as appetizers were pretty good and so was the appetizer bread. I had a winter pie as a drink and didn't like it as much. My boyfriend ordered a egg cream it was actually pretty good and different.The place-- like usual--is packed! So you might have to wait a long time! Wouldn't go again."
Michele L.,"Chico, CA",7/17/2017,4.0,"My husband and I enjoyed our visit to the Founding Farmers. Our waitress, Anna, was really nice and attentive. I ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes as well as Shrimp and Grits. Both were prepared well and very tasty. My husband ordered the Meatloaf. Sadly, the center was uncooked and he could not eat it. We finished off the dinner with Red Velvet Cake at Anna's suggestion. It was moist and flavorful. Looking forward to eating at Founding Farmers on our next visit to DC!"
Foodie F.,"New York, NY",2/20/2017,4.0,"Delicious southern food that's farm to table. Started with these delicious cocktails that we loved, Clementine and cucumber cocktails.  Had corn bread, blue cheese bacon dates and the spicy crab corn dip. It was so flavorful and delicious!  I was surprised at how rich the food was. Don't go if you're on a diet! The spicy crab dip was unbelievably good. Must have along with the corn bread!  We also had the salt crusted Prime Rib with the sweet potato and 7 cheese mac. Extremely disappointed with the 2 sides. Would not recommend. Everything else was great including the service!  Would def go back!"
Caroline S.,"Arlington, VA",6/30/2017,4.0,"The service always seems haphazard, but I love the food. Best kale salad of your life! Amazing chicken and waffles."
Patreace T.,"Glen Allen, VA",3/1/2017,4.0,"I like this place, the staff is very nice and knowledgeable. Even though they do not have a gluten free menu they can tell you what is and what is not gf and what can be made gf. They have seasonal drinks as well and whatever it was that I got was very tasty. They give you pretty nice size portions. I'm a fan of the farm to table concept and the freshness of everything. I ended up going to this place two days in a row with different people at their suggestions and I didn't have a complaint or try to stir them away, I had not problem eating here two days in a row. I do hope they offer more gf dishes in the future."
Michael O.,"Patuxent River, MD",1/27/2017,2.0,"If you watch food network and you get excited by words like bold, sweet, savory, earthy, complex, and other terms ""regular joe's"" don't use to describe food, then you'll probably like this place.  If you and your friends have deep conversations about that new restaurant that everyone is talking about, then you'll like it. And if you only go to places where you can only book a reservation online, this might be the place for you.  For us, it was just ok. We went for lunch with no reservation and waited 45 minutes. ~30 people came in behind us and we're seated first.  And I'm SURE they all had reservations...We had ""Proudly Served"" tap water, skillet cornbread, chicken pot pie, and pot roast. The cornbread was very sweet, had corn in it, and was more of a cake consistency. And yes, the honey-butter was butter with honey poured over it. Good, but add some ice cream, and they have a new desert item. The chicken pot pie was sweet, as our waitress indicated. However,  not really pleasing. It was so sweet, the ""savory"" was long gone. I know, right.  ""Sweet pot pie?  What???""  Exactly...The pot roast was ok, but had similar issues that were NOT consistent with what your Nanna used to feed you. It had the regular stuff. It also had beets and asparagus. And something was seasoned with either nutmeg or cinnamon. BOTTOM LINE:  It was worth a try, but not for us. Decent establishment. Great waitress. Too busy/noisy for inside voices.  And they're NOT serving food like Grandma...  And some things just can't be made better with whacky food science."
Chase S.,"Baltimore, MD",4/7/2017,5.0,"When you are STRESSED AND NEED MORE THAN A MOMENT, come here!   My husband and I were expecting a regular breakfast and a couple of drinks. We ended up staying longer.  Breakfast and lunch was phenomenal! The bartender,Tommy, was more than talented. He created so many drinks and his presentation was unbelievable. Charles (aka Charlie) was super cool too. His bartending and customer service was amazing.  Need a great time. Want great drinks.  Respect the bartending game and the two that work very together...Charlie and Tommy are who you need. Fantastic job, Founding Farmers!"
Sue W.,"North Reading, MA",5/2/2017,5.0,Loved the breakfast!  Everything was fresh and delicious.  We were a party of 7 and sat upstairs in a round booth.  We loved the blueberry pancake with blueberry butter. Another favorite of the group was the eggs Benedict.  The manager of the day was super friendly!  I left my cell phone in the bathroom by mistake and she found it and kept it by the front desk.  I was so relieved as it also held my license and ATM card that I wanted to give her a little $.  She absolutely refused and said she was just glad she made my day! How nice is that!!!I would definitely find time to go here again next time I am in DC.
Michelle K.,"Washington, DC",2/27/2017,4.0,"Did the brunch buffet with a friend last weekend and in general, very much enjoyed ourselves. I showed up in person at 10:30am on a Saturday and put in for a table for two. Was told the wait would be an hour and we were pleasantly surprised to be called up after about 40 mns. Service was great for the most part, but iffy at times. Even though we had an assigned waitress, it was very ""team"" oriented. Which seemed to diffuse the responsibility of getting my friend silverware after asking twice and waiting about 10 mns.But the food did not disappoint! Most impressive was the variety - from french toast to soft tacos and lots in between. The fried chicken was especially flavorful. And we of course went back for dessert! Took our time sipping refills on coffee and enjoying the sweets and never felt rushed to leave.Definitely would recommend! But prepare to not be hungry again for the following 4 days..."
Jennifer K.,"Austin, TX",6/29/2017,5.0,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's so cute and only about thirty minutes away by walk from the main mall and the popular attractions surrounding it. I got their sausage and mushroom gnocchi. I wish the gnocchi pieces were smaller as they were very dense and large. However, it tasted great! Very rich though, so maybe share with another person. My friend got their chicken and waffles, which was pretty bomb. I liked how they left the bone in the chicken. Be prepared to wait for a bit if you come during peak times for dinner/lunch."
Jeremy H.,"Dupont Circle, Washington, DC",8/26/2016,5.0,"DC must-do, loved the chicken and steak enchiladas. Cornbread is to die for. Grilled cheese and soup is a good lunch item, little oily. Get the hibiscus soda. Make a reservation or go around 2pm. Ideal meal if you want to relax, have a great conversation with your waiter. I took my parents here and they absolutely loved it. Take your guests here, it's iconic."
Rahil S.,"Potomac, MD",7/16/2017,5.0,The wait was long but it worth it. I recommend calling before going there. We ordered the Banana foster stuffed French toast and the steak and eggs. Really great. We will go there again but will definitely make a reservation.Price: reasonable Staff: friendly and fast
Melike E.,"Washington, DC",8/27/2017,4.0,"Great food and service. I love their brunch and also dinner entrees, great portion and taste."
Art G.,"San Diego, CA",8/23/2017,5.0,"We had the mussels, butternut ravioli and goat cheese ravioli.  This place ranks as one of the best meals I've had in DC. Flavors blend nicely and the food is excellent.  The homemade beverages are highly recommended."
Yesenia M.,"Washington, DC",2/24/2017,5.0,"The food here never disappoints!  I love the options and everything comes at a pretty great price point.  I've lived in the DMV area for 4 months and have already been here 3 times.  I've had the bourbon french toast which is amazing, it's lighter than the other french toast options which are stuffed but also very delicious.  I had the strawberries and cream which might be my favorite thing on the menu, it's a very 'shareable' plate especially if you throw in a side of hashbrowns and eggs.  The coffee is decent and but I'm not a fan of the hot chocolate and since I usually drive there I haven't sampled their drinks....yet!  I've been to the Tyson location and prefer this one in every aspect.  I can't stress enough how much i advise making a reservation beforehand but if you forgot to there's still a pretty good chance you can hover around the bar area and grab some seats there.  I typically end up at the bar and it's quite comfortable with ample space for food and good service."
Hall W.,"Washington, DC",8/23/2016,4.0,"I came here for cocktail drinks. First off - there are a lot of cocktail options and they are quite pricey (really should be 3 dollar signs). Be warned, this place is super popular, so if you don't time it just right, you could be stuck in a hot and bumpy crowd.Once you get over those issues, then you have a delightful experience.The drinks aren't too alcoholicy, just well balanced and well made.The atmosphere isn't too loud and urban sophisticated but with a natural feel.The staff is super friendly and helpful"
Isabelle S.,"Terre Haute, IN",6/22/2017,5.0,"Be prepared as you may have to wait in line to get a seat in this place. I would advise making reservations as it does get pretty packed. Once you get in the place has a very nice open atmosphere. The breakfast is one of my favorites as they have very good pancakes and excellent banana peanut butter toast. They also have a drink menu with bloody marys, bellinis, mimosas and other types of adult beverages. This is a must stop breakfast place to add to your D.C. to do list."
L F.,"Randallstown, MD",3/26/2017,3.0,"The food was just OK. Honestly, I don't understand all the hype. We had reservations and STILL had to wait.  The waiter service was on point though. I tried the pot pie and didn't really care for the sauce. There were a few other dishes tried and I just wasn't all that thrilled about them. Would I go back? No. It wasn't that mind blowing to me."
David K.,"San Jose, CA",2/23/2016,3.0,"3 1/2 stars. It's a solid restaurant and has a nice ambiance, people are excited to go here, but one of our orders was disappointing. We made a reservation the night before we were going to go, which was a mistake on our part. The only open slot for Saturday was between 2:30-4ish, which isn't brunch time anymore. We decided to go anyways because we wanted to try this place, which many people had been buzzing about. We didn't have to wait to long once we got there, ten minutes tops as they got us to our reserved table. The fried green tomatoes are a nice appetizer, though I laugh at the concept of it. Whoever came up with it must've been looking for anything to fry in his/her kitchen one day and could only find a tomato. Texture wise, fried potato or sweet potato slices would be a lot better. Alas they don't have it, and we're stuck with fried tomatoes. The two sauces that come with it our excellent though, I think they're called the green goddess dip and herb goat cheese. Made me want to use it on everything. For entrees we got the shrimp grits and the chicken and waffles. The shrimp grits were pretty good, good flavor and good portion size, I guess grits just isn't my thing. The chicken and waffles was the one I was really disappointed it. The waffle was soggy and so was the fried chicken. This is before any syrup or anything was put on top of it. When I think chicken and waffles, the lens I've had in the past, the waffles were golden and crispy, and the chicken skin crispy and the meat tender. Hopefully this was just a one time thing, with it being 3pm in the afternoon."
Caroline K.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1/25/2016,5.0,"Told my friends I'm heading to DC and several homies said I had to try this place. Luckily, I got the last reservation for a Saturday brunch. It was freaking crowded- make sure you make a reservation or you are going to wait. Everything was so good and fresh! Potroast: Delicious. The meat is so tender and melts in your mouth and it is lying on a bed of mashed potatoes. Chicken & Waffles: Chicken was perfect and tender and fried perfectly. Not too oily and not too soggy. The waffle is light yet crispy, loved it as well.Beignets: They were perfect. Light and flaky. The dipping sauces that come with it are sooo good. I freaking loved the raspberry and the chocolate one.Cornbread: Has little pieces of corn in it and comes hot in a skillet. Delicious!"
Farah G.,"Miami Springs, FL",12/31/2016,5.0,"On my 11 day trip to D.C. I loved this place so much that I came here twice! We didn't have any reservations but we were still seated very quickly! (Less than 10 minutes) We even went with a party of 9 the second time and we were still seated almost right away! The service was great and all of the staff and waiters were very kind, polite and professional! I ordered the Brie Bread, Cornbread, and the Chicken and Waffles! The breads are delicious! The Brie bread was amazing! The apple slices and onion jam complemented both the cheese and bread perfectly!!  The chicken and waffles were so good we ordered them both times!!! The chicken was crispy and perfectly breaded! The mac and cheese was among the best I have ever had!! The waffles were crispy and moist! The maple syrup tasted home made and full of delicious maple goodness!! I got the double whipped potatoes and those were amazing! Everything was so fresh!!!! The sweet potato was okay but the star of the show was definitely the mac and cheese in regards to the sides! We also drank the Manhattan soda and that was very unique! Definitely worth a try! Someone in our table also got a home made soda and i was able to try it! Very good!!! You can't go wrong with anything honestly, it is all very farm to table and well made! Both times we went the service was excellent!"
Sean H.,"Evanston, IL",11/11/2016,4.0,"Amazing restaurant. Blackberry Sour is superb. And the cornbread with honey butter and corn kernels is to die for. If you get anything, get the cornbread.I ordered slow-braised beef short rib with red potatoes and seasonal escabeche for my main course. Sauce on the meat is a little sweeter and BBQ like than I expected. Thought it should have a darker sauce. But really well cooked meat. Veggies are ok - wasn't expecting them cold. Potatoes are rich and creamy. Dessert! Red velvet cake. Cake is a little dry, but the cream cheese icing is thick and delicious, and the vanilla bean ice cream pairs very well. Atmosphere is rustic and lighting is moody and bare (in a good way) but not too dark. Great place to hang out after a long day, or for a nice dinner. Definitely would come back for the drinks and cornbread, although maybe not for dinner. But they do have a lot more to try on their menu!"
Rachel D.,"Dallas, TX",4/4/2017,5.0,"Food: Chicken Pot Pie -- amazing!!! Drinks: The Constitution. So so good.The only thing that's frustrating is that even if you make a reservation, you still end up having to wait 15-20 minutes to be seated... a little ridiculous. Also, the waiting area / to get to the hostess is an incredibly crowded and stressful experience. They need to do something about that!!!"
Stephanie C.,"East Amherst, NY",7/5/2017,5.0,Our bartender was great and made me the best Bloody Mary I've ever had. Food was also great and the staff was very friendly. I'll definitely be going back.
D W.,"Seattle, WA",7/14/2017,5.0,"Shocker, this place is awesome. I go here everything I am in D.C.  Chicken and Waffles, full stop. If the line is too long and there is no space at the bar, head down the street to El Chalan for some great Peruvian food."
Joy Y.,"New York, NY",1/3/2016,4.0,"New Years Day brunch. We shared skillet cornbread and an order of leek hash brown. The corn bread tasted better after it chilled a bit imo, and it's so nice that there are whole corn kernels in it. The hash brown is flavorless and doesn't hold up so skip it. My friend enjoyed her lobster mac & cheese which had a generous portion of lobster. I got the many vegetable salad which was tasty but the true star of the dish was actually the slice of toasted peasant bread that came with - it was actually the best slice of bread I've had in a long time.Our server was kinda rude tbh. I asked him how much a side of leek hash brown would be and he told me ""it says on the menu"" in a tone as if I couldn't read. The menu actually really doesn't say. He also forgot our order of fried green tomatoes. But considering how busy this joint is, the staff moves efficiently enough for everyone to enjoy their meal."
Peter K.,"Great Falls, VA",7/14/2017,3.0,"The fried chicken was excellent, but overall the resturant doesnt live up to it's hype."
George C.,"New York, NY",1/1/2017,3.0,"Breakfast is a hard stop @10:59am. We never got our salt&pepper the first time we asked. Our table was wobbly. But ultimately we enjoyed our meal and felt everything was a good value, even if I really doubt the Founding Farmers would have recognized a vast majority of it (and nothing was really seasonal/local, just scratch made)."
Mollyrose W.,"Jacksonville, NC",4/28/2017,5.0,"My husband and I came here for the first time today and we seriously loved it! The cornbread and wings were the perfect appetizers. My husband had the goat cheese ravioli and I got the fried chicken salad with a side of mac and cheese. I personally wasn't crazy about the ravioli but my husband loved it. The salad has a dressing that is a combination of ranch, honey mustard, and a vinigarette . Seriously it might be the best dressing I've ever had on a salad. Our waitress was Jai and she was awesome! I would definitely recommend coming here to grab a great meal!"
Michelle G.,"Clemson, SC",11/8/2016,5.0,"Food: the food here was amazing! Every bite was saddening because it meant there would be that much less food left. I came from breakfast and ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The batter that they use for the waffles is amazing and the chicken is seasoned perfectly to compliment it. My boyfriend ordered the bourbon french toast with a side of black pepper maple glazed bacon. Both of these were great orders. The bacon was a very thick cut and was perfectly smoked. Atmosphere: A nice casual, but not too casual spot. The pricing was fair for the quality and quantity of food received. Service: The service was quick and great! Friendly and helpful staff."
kristen C.,"Arlington, VA",1/7/2017,1.0,"I gave them one star because at least the manager accommodated us for our party because one person wasn't there and our waiter was nice. But when we walked in there was someone braiding another girls hair (folks that worked there) at the hostess station. Gross. Then the other hostess that was there was really rude throughout any other interaction we had.  It then took 15 minutes to have 2 drinks (old fashion and a specialty drink brought to the table. Then when our food came, (I had ordered the fish of the day) the fish was oversalted. I ordered a side of green beans and sweet potato. (Literally they gave me like 10 green beans and one half of a sweet potato.) some of the green beans weren't trimmed and I pulled a giant string from one of them. My friend that also ordered he sweet potato had two.It was just not the dining experience I remember and I can't believe I had to pay for it."
Lisa D.,"Glen Cove, NY",8/16/2016,4.0,"Really, really good. My brother and sister and I stopped in last Friday night around 5.  We'd never heard of it, but it looked cute.I had the crab cakes with a side of salted watermelon and the green beans with candied lemon.  Yum. Yum. Yum.  I don't really like watermelon, but it was SO hot out that I could not bring myself to eat a heavy, starchy side.  It was really delicious.The crab cakes were phenomenal by the standards of where i live (Long Island), but I'd say only 'quite good' if you're a VA/MD local.My sister had a bucatini with cream sauce, bacon and farm-fresh vegetables.  To die for.  The only problem was (as I noted above) that it was SO hot out, she was quite uncomfortable by the time we walked to the White House. However, I'd say it was good enough to spring for the taxi back to a/c afterwardsMy brother had a sort of platter of ribs and hot dog and sliders and things... it had the only ""meh"" food item of the evening: those weird not-really-potato-chips-not-really-fries that seem to be all the rage.  These were almost to the level of awful because every other bite on that plate was phenomenal.The service was just fine.  The server was very nice (and listened very patiently while my brother told him how much those not-really-chips needed to not be on the plate) but he did not offer us drink refills (it was just SO hot out, it would have been nice to be able to take away a drink).  Also, they told us we had to eat and leave to make way for a reservation, which was clearly not necessary given the relative level of crowding when we left."
Ron C.,"Roswell, GA",8/22/2017,5.0,"Ate here recently on a trip to the DC area and was told that we must get at least one meal at FF.  So, in the middle of a Saturday afternoon, we sat down after having to wait for an hour, to a great meal.  I was somewhat surprised to experience such a long wait since it was what i thought to be an off-hour (3:00), but it was well worth the wait.  Some of the highlights were the skillet corn bread, farm bread brie onion, chicken & waffles and the crab cakes.  And our server, Liam, was great.  Will definitely be back on our next visit."
Beverly C.,"Indianapolis, IN",7/11/2016,5.0,"My friend took me to Founding Farmers when I was visiting for the weekend about 2 months ago. We went for a late dinner on a Friday night. There was a long wait but we lucked up on two seats at the bar. We both got the same thing: the fried chicken and waffles, mac n cheese, and green beans. The guy next to us at the bar ordered the exact same meal! Good portions and the price is typical for the area. It was delicious! Everything is seasoned well with good flavor. The girls next to us ordered dessert! I regret not getting dessert to go! I will return next time I'm in DC."
Nicole G.,"Milton, VT",6/28/2016,4.0,"We came here on our second day in DC for our honeymoon! It was on my must-visit list for DC. I picked the strawberry and cream french toast and a orange soda! My husband got french toast. We also got a order of the peanut butter banana toast. We liked everything get got, but man was it really sweet! Even for me it was a bit much. I loved the orange soda, it was really interesting and you could tell they used real oranges in the soda! It made me curious about the other hand crafted sodas. Service was friendly, nice and efficient. The toast did come out after the main meal and that really put a damper on the toast, but it was also quite interesting and I would definitely get it again.  We would surely return if ever in the DC area again."
Christine H.,"Washington, DC",2/15/2016,4.0,"I must be a fan seeing as how I've been to all 3 locations (and Farmers Fishers Bakers, but that is another story)!The food is great. It can be a little on the heavy side due to the heavy Southern influences, but just go with the intention of enjoying yourself and letting loose a little.Specific menu items either that I've ordered or snuck bites of while my eating companion was in the bathroom:- Ginger scratch soda is EN POINTE. - Maybe you can't buy happiness, but the $5 skillet corn bread comes pretty damn close.- I remember having a trout special one visit, very well seasoned and prepared!- Lobster mac n' cheese is great! I personally liked this version more than the one I had at the much lauded Red Hook Lobster Pound at Brooklyn Flea in NYC- Chicken & Waffles offered slightly dry chicken, but the waffles SAVED this dish for me- Fried Green Tomatoes are good! I had them when a friend brought me for afternoon tea at the MoCo location, very solid.To wrap this up, as much as I've talked up their food, the SERVICE was (and always is) BETTER. I've never had an unpleasant service experience here. From the host/ hostess to the waitstaff, everyone is so cheerful and look like they genuinely love having you there. Great southern charm all around from Founding Farmers. Awesome job."
Stella K.,"Cambridge, MA",8/14/2016,5.0,"Absolutely amazing! Went there for Sunday brunch - had to have reservations (which we made on Thursday!!!). The place was packed, but we were seated on time. We had scrambled eggs and pancakes, and finished the meal with their delicious beignets. Despite being busy we were not rushed out of our table, and really enjoyed our meal. I really loved this place - clean, delicious and creative food, fresh ingredients and fun and modern atmosphere. A must-visit in DC!!"
Daniel B.,"Orlando, FL",7/12/2017,5.0,"This is my favorite restaurant in all of D.C.! Anything you get will be absolutely amazing, from cornbread to the vegetable sides.  Their apple pie is to die for and I really love the pork chop.  Atmosphere is not too fancy, more like upscale casual dining.  Their waitstaff knows about the menu and is always ready to answer any questions. I strongly recommend this place."
Nina R.,"Fairfax, VA",12/21/2015,3.0,"Visited here recently for Sunday brunch with friends.  Luckily, we had reservations and waited only a few minutes to get seated.  The entrance area is very chaotic because there were a lot of people waiting.We were seated and the hostess and our waitress were all very polite and patient.  Even though they were extremely busy, I did not feel rushed at any point.I ordered the famous Chicken and Waffles.  This came with a white gravy and your choice of an egg.  I asked for scrambled well with cheese (I assumed cheddar or American, and it came with cheddar, yumm).  Two other friends of mine also ordered the Chicken and Waffles!  It was a hit.  The fried chicken tenders were tasty and seasoned really well.  Just enough flavor.  However, my two friends received more chicken than I did :-(  That sort of annoyed me that my plate was not equally distributed, but oh well, I didn't want to make a fuss.The waffles were not super hot, the butter did not melt, just sort of sat there.  Oh well again.  But I was so happy to eat waffles!  Something I NEVER order because of the carbs, but what the heck, right!?We were all satisfied with our orders.  Another friend ordered 2 appetizers to make a meal, including the garlicky chicken wings.  I tried one and the garlic and green onions overpowered the flavor.  Great presentation, but way too much garlic for my comfort.Other than that, I was super excited to dine here.  Service was really nice.  There are tons of people so it was exciting to people watch and be in the mix.  Next time, I think I will explore the menu a bit more.  The chicken and waffles is definitely a huge hit, but I'm ready to go back and explore the menu."

Jen F.,"Washington, DC",1/8/2017,4.0,We came for brunch and it was delicious! The one thing I ate and still think about is the banana peanut butter toast! It was incredible and I recreate it at home all the time. Do yourself a favor and order it!
E W.,"Bowie, MD",4/25/2017,3.0,"Ive always wanted to try this restaurant so today I finally did and I must say it really wasn't what I expected. I must say the presentation of my food was amazing but the flavor didn't stand up to appearance I got the shrimp and grits the flavor was balanced but this dish reminded me more of a gumbo then shrimp and grits, it had a lot going on and that sorta took away from the shrimp and grits taste that I was expecting. My bf got some type of Seafood dish, cod, shrimp and mussels and screamed mediocre. Maybe will come back and try their breakfast menu."
Lilly N.,"Falls Church, VA",1/14/2016,3.0,"This place was popping and the food is awesome! We got the chicken and waffles and the tuna salad. I absolutely loved the tuna salad. The tuna was raw and it was very refreshing. I thought the amount of salad was just right and that it filled you up, but didn't make you too full so that you felt stuffed. The fried chicken was tender and juicy, but I felt the outside was a bit too salty. The waffles were fluffy and the dish comes with a side of your choosing. My friend picked the red potato mash, which was good but it solidified towards the end of the meal so that it wasn't that smooth anymore. The reason why I put 3 stars was because I was not crazy about our server. She kept us waiting a bit to put in our orders and even when we had put in our order we waited for at least 30mins for the food to come out. I want to say 30min was being generous; it was probably longer than that. Our server did not check on us at all as well. I was not thrilled, but was distracted by the company to notice that all that much at the time. Maybe I was just being impatient because we had somewhere we had to be as well. Overall, the ambiance was very nice. The food was very good, but I was not very happy with the service."
Shannon D.,"Las Vegas, NV",4/10/2017,2.0,"Don't believe the hype. It is difficult for me to trust yelp when I travel. I find that reviews tend to be either 1) relative rather than absolute, or 2) a victim of the lack of knowledge of the population of the city. If you have never had truly excellent food then a restaurant like Founding Farmers may seem like good food. Perhaps even 5 star worthy.  The truth is that the food is mediocre at best and overpriced.  Waitress recommended the ribs, they were horrible.  Their ""homemade"" BBQ sauce was too tart and ribs were fatty, tough and bland. No smoke in them. I know what you are going to say. ""You were the idiot who ordered ribs in DC thinking they were going to be good"". Maybe I am just mad because I trust my server.  I always ask, ""what would you order?""  The deviled eggs were bland. The beignets were oily and raw inside (they also took 20 minutes to come out).  Go to the Old Ebbitt bar or the Lafayette room if you are looking to get a good meal in DC.  Skip Founding Farmers. If you are one of the reviewers that gave this a 5 star, please go try food at good restaurants and then update your rating on Founding Farmers to the 2 or 3 stars it deserves."
Karen B.,"Nashville, TN",1/20/2017,5.0,"I started and ended with dessert... The BEST chocolate mousse in the States. Perfect consistency, not too sweet, depth if chocolate was delish. Paired with a hearty Kith & Kin, divine!"
Heather C.,"Vacaville, CA",12/30/2016,3.0,"We came here for breakfast and had a reservation. The placed was literally packed but we were seated quickly, within 10 minutes.We sat down at a nice table and the restaurant was clean and comfortable. We were greeted by a young waitress who was very nice and welcoming. Unfortunately, that was where the service dropped off. We ordered a coffee and three OJs which took forever to get. Our food arrived very quickly once we ordered but several of the items were cold and not hot. We had to return them for a new order. The waitress did not come by regularly and check on us and often we had to hound another server down to get basics, butter, more coffee, etc. The food was just ok. The hash browns were good, but they came varied in doneness. One of our orders were barely cooked and one was crispy brown. The bacon was the best part and the waffles were delicious. I would give the food 4 stars, if it comes out hot. Price was fair but the service was pretty pathetic and needs a lot of refining and would only give it 2 stars. Overall they get a three from me. I should not feel like I have had a better breakfast experience at a chain."
Scott D.,"Philadelphia, PA",7/1/2017,5.0,"We rolled in on a saturday morning without a reservation at about 9am.  There was an hour wait if you didn't have a reservation (didn't think about reservations, duh!) but we didn't mind, it gave us time to go check out the White House and sight see.  Conveniently, they text you when your name is coming up...and it's not an 'auto text', its actually a person.  I responded that we had a 10 minute walk back when they texted me and they promptly replied that they would hold the table...good job!Super crowded spot but the service was great and prompt, which is a terrific sign of a well run establishment.Our group had chicken and waffles, 2 versions of the stuffed french toast and a traditional breakfast as well as the biegnets.  The chicken and waffles were the best I've ever eaten and I order chicken and waffles (and go to joints known for chicken and waffles) quite a lot.  The waffle was so light and fluffy (how did they do that?) and the boneless chicken strips (thank you for serving boneless chicken) were so tender and beautifully seasoned.  Amazing!The Bacon in the traditional breakfast was to die for, the hash browns were also way above average.  The stuffed french toast is very interestingly presented (kind of like big square twinkies my son said) but may have been just a bit too sweet/rich?  They were delicious, but neither of my boys could eat all of it and that is unusual.  Still, they were delicious served cold back at the house that night.The coffee was also amazing and the fresh squeezed juice as good as it gets.  Can't go wrong for breakfast here."
Mel B.,"Baltimore, MD",12/28/2015,5.0,"I have been wanting to try Founding Farmers for a while but for some reason or another I have always needed to cancel my reservations (lame). ANYWAYS, my handsome man decided to surprise me and take me here a few nights ago (major points for him). The wait is a little annoying because you are put in a little corner. However, we arrived pretty early and they seated us before our reservation time, so that was excellent and we only needed to be in said corner for ~10 minutes. It was funny because I have looked at the menu for this place a million times and read so many reviews, so I knew exactly what I wanted without even needing a menu. To start, we had the skillet corn bread and glazed bacon lollis. Corn bread was great but the golden appetizer star went to the bacon lollis (no surprise, right?). They were delicious, interesting, perfect, smoky, yummy, etc.etc. For my meal I got the pot roast. Good lawd, it was just amazing. Melt in your mouth, amazing.  Veggies were cooked perfectly and the meat was so tender and full of flavor. OH and the gravy??---best I have ever had. I think it was my favorite part of the dish. My mouth is watering as I write this review. I love you, Founding Farmers pot roast. My man got the prime rib dip with mashed potatoes. He really enjoyed it and said the bread was outstanding. I had a bite and it was good, but we both agreed that it was a little unmemorable and that the pot roast stole the show. This place is such a perfect pick for a nice dinner. Fun and unique environment, gorgeous food presentation, and amazing food. Cannot wait to go back....I already know what I will be getting the second time around!"
Olga N.,"Washington, DC",7/11/2016,3.0,"I've been to Founding Farmers at least 30 times over the years. I went there for brunch and dinner, drinks, large group meals and intimate meals. The restaurant was close to work and was the dining venue of choice by default - otherwise I would not be coming here so much.I was reluctant to review it since I knew how much my friends and colleagues loved it. I, on the other hand, have to admit - I'm with Tom Sietsema on this one. I could never understand why this place is always so packed. It's mostly comfort food - not bad comfort food but not very memorable either. The service is very mediocre as well. Again, I've never had a bad experience  here but nothing struck me as very pleasant either.One funny moment - once I organized a big group dinner here and Founding Farmers printed pre-selected menu choices for our guests. Instead of putting the name of the organization or the event (which was quite formal), they put ""Olga's Party"" at the top of each menu. We all had a good chuckle and somehow it seemed to go well with the laid back ambiance and overpriced comfort food."
Roxie D.,"Rockville, MD",6/23/2017,4.0,"Food is great, as always with this chain. The lines are out the door so be sure to make reservations before heading in. I was there with a party of 8 or so and we had great service and though it was super busy, our server was super nice and did not rush us at all."
Pudgy C.,"Washington D.C., DC",3/18/2017,5.0,"I recently dined here before seeing a show at the Kennedy Center.  I had reservations and was seated right away on the upper level.  I dined with 1 other person and we order an appetizer a piece.  Cornbread and fried green tomatoes.  Both were good.  For my entrée I ordered the mushroom risotto which was adequate with barley which I really enjoyed because it wasn't mushy but had a nice bite to it.  The server (Denisha) was great. She was attentive, but she allowed us to enjoy our meal.  I can't wait to return.  They have a very interesting menu."
Jackie S.,"New York, NY",6/15/2016,5.0,"No joke, two months ago when my coworker and I found out we have to go to DC on a quickie business trip, a reservation at Founding Farmers was made within minutes. I had never been, and she swears by it.This review has two parts: I arrived an hour before my reservation to meet another friend for a drink so we sat at the bar. The second part is the actual dinner. At 5:30pm the bar was packed. Luckily, we snagged the last two seats. The bartenders are amazing and so friendly. Our drinks were great (though New York prices). Then comes the dinner...WOW. I swear I probably looked at the menu for a solid two hours figuring out the best way to attack it for our order. We started with the breads, chips, crisps appetizer and it was SO good. The chips, the crackers, the bread, the carbs, the dips, the CHEEEEEEESE! Then for my entree I ordered the many vegetable salad and added salmon. BOMB. Everything was fresh, the salmon was cooked perfectly, the portion was rather large, and whatever they do to the peanuts in the salad is crack. My friend had the rotisserie chicken and loved it as well. Make a reservation, by 8:00pm it's so packed people are even waiting outside.Until next time, my beloved Founding Farmers."
Mike P.,"Tucson, AZ",6/16/2017,5.0,"Food is really good & decently priced.  They can accommodate walk-ins with bar seating that includes the full menu (reservations are also an option).  The service is great!  They helped me find Vegan options on their breakfast menu & allowed me to substitute a second side for the bread.  I highly recommend this place.  Make sure you budget time for your meal though, this place is perpetually busy."
Lola O.,"Rockville, MD",6/9/2017,2.0,I like Founding Farmers but I'm not a fan of this location. It was packed so we sat at the bar. The bartender wasn't the cleanest  (when we made drinks and rinsed his hands the water from his hands dripped into the drinks he was making). My food was also lukewarm.  I won't be back.  I'll stick to the MoCo location
Amira K.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/2/2017,3.0,"Unclear why there are 8,000 reviews and most of them are stellar (?!).I was visiting from New York and wanted a nice NYE meal with my boyfriend ... Though the drinks we ordered were good, I wouldn't go back unless it was to have a few cocktails. Overall, the food was strange and unsatisfying. I'll start from the beginning.We ordered a pickled plate as an appetizer, in which they served us just pickles. They were good, I guess, but not at all what we wanted.Also, trying to order bread to share between my boyfriend (omnivore) and myself (vegan) was a nightmare. None of their bread was vegan, and instead we shared their homemade potato chips with sub-par dips. Not satisfying at all. I understand  using milk in bread is culinary choice, but still unnecessary.As a vegan, they were accommodating, but their meatless options seemed like an afterthought. I ordered the mushroom burger, which didn't have enough sauce and the white bread buns straight up crumbled in my hand. Also strange, it featured random slices of smoked tofu that seemed out of place and added nothing. One bright spot: the side salad it came with was pretty solid.None of the dishes felt too fresh or as if they captured the true essence of the ingredients it used.The ""farm-to-table"" concept didn't quite make it to our table, if you ask me."
Billie C.,"Knoxville, TN",6/29/2017,5.0,Ate here a while back really loved the sugar coated Kettle Corn ! Extremely different all of the food was fresh farm style. Highly recommend a visit here while in Washington DC!

Updated review",5.0,Great meal but not great service. I wasn't expecting massive crowds on a Tuesday mid morning but it was packed. We opted to sit at the bar which wasn't a good idea. The bar tenders are way overworked. The coffee and food was amazing. I got the farmers breakfast and my friend got the strawberry stuffed French toast. I would definitely go back for the food alone.
Rukiya U.,"Los Angeles, CA",8/10/2017,5.0,"I recently moved to D.C. and this place came highly recommended from a previous D.C resident. First off, let me say how delicious this place is. It is worth every penny! The space may seem a  little right depending on where you're seating but it's quickly forgotten once you take the first bite of food. I've ordered the sausage & mushroom gnocchi which is doused in an Amaretto sauce--warning: may cause an orgasm in your mouth. For the appetizer, I ordered the black pepper and garlic wings which were very tasty. They had an Asian flavor profile. They also have handmade sodas which were lovely! Finally, the highlight (if that's even possible) would be the beignets. I'm not a huge fan of traditional beignets because of their dense consistency but these beignets are light and come paired with 3 sauces: raspberry, chocolate, and caramel. If you have a little extra money to spend on a meal, I would definitely recommend Founding Farmers. It is everything one would want in a restaurant: impeccable service, great drinks, fantastic ambiance, and delicious food."
Amanda B.,"Washington, DC",2/1/2017,4.0,"I like Founding Farmers for its diverse menu, locally sourced ingredients and unique cocktails. It has a lively environment and friendly service. Their bartenders are creative and can make a mean cocktail on demand without much instruction! I've had two vegetable-based dishes - the vegetable avacado sandwich and the butternut squash ravioli. Both were delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed them. However, if you are seeking a ""healthy"" dish and think that a restaurant that has ""Farmers"" in the name is the spot, I'm not so sure about that. Plenty of that delicious buttery goodness in everything I've tasted thus far. This is the type of place I'd visit if I wanted a sure crowd-pleaser, as they've got a bit of everything on the menu. Make an Open Table reservation...I think there's almost always a wait."
Jen J.,"Old Bridge, NJ",4/6/2017,4.0,"My boyfriend and I took a weekend trip down to D.C. and he had heard from numerous people to check this place out. We went in on a Friday around 4pm, and got really lucky with no wait at all. I can't remember the names of the drinks we ordered, but they were good (nothing special and overpriced, imo). We started with the Skillet Cornbread, and I LOVED it. The honey butter was amazing. My boyfriend ordered a pasta dish that he's still been raving as one of the best dishes he ever had. I ordered a Reuben, which was really great and tasted super fresh. Overall, I would definitely come here again when I get the chance - It was great."
Ross S.,"Manhattan, NY",7/8/2017,4.0,A delicious diverse selection of food. Amazing rye cocktails and great in house cafe.  We will definitely be coming back here to eat!
Janet T.,"Manhattan, NY",5/5/2017,1.0,"$117 bill for 2 for lunch .. 2 cocktails, prosciutto on stale bread on some disgusting sweet black sauce, lobster Mac nasty cheese 28$ shrimp Shit Cobb 18$ asked for a to go cup for my whatever cocktail because I had to feed the meter and was told its illegal lmao  yes Washington you are square .. yes you are near the White House ... or should I say the orange house ?? So disappointed , yelp you failed me today. Advice would be loosen up, enjoy your job, lay off the sauces and let the food speak for it self. You can smile! all in all this is for the tourist, not the real foodies. Left a sour taste in my mouth... thank you, never again."
Kenya M.,"Rockville, MD",7/31/2016,4.0,I love this place! The food is always fresh and delicious! Good lord the fried chicken is good and the turkey sandwich is the best ever! And the meatless menu is the best. (You can tell I come here alot.)
Jenna C.,"ASTORIA, NY",6/15/2016,5.0,"Came here last night while on a work trip. We ordered the bread basket, and I had rotisserie chicken. Both were delicious. The service was fine and fast and the food was hot and flavorful. The prices are honest and fair. The green beans were awesome. Candied lemon was fantastic. Absolutely worth a visit, but you'll need a reservation!"
John S.,"San Diego, CA",2/26/2017,4.0,Really liked the devil-ish eggs and fried chicken salad.  I thought the spare ribs were good as well.  Would have liked it better if the appetizers cane out before the entrees though.
V S.,"Moorpark, CA",3/24/2017,5.0,"Very great Washington DC food experience. I'm vegan, and I had their veggie mushroom loaf. Amazing!!!  I scarfed it down. Very flavorful...had a homemade taste and texture to it. My son had chicken and waffles and practically licked his plate. Nice environment. Good fresh homemade tasting food. Will think of this place fondly."
Melissa V.,"Riverview, FL",9/26/2016,5.0,"If you're looking for a place with authentic & organic food then this is the place. Our waitress was awesome. She suggested we try their signature  beignets & gosh so lucky we did. Fried dough with powered sugar & it comes with 3 dipping sauces. The raspberry dipping sauce was my favorite. I ordered the crab egg Benedict. It tasted good, had a good seasoning mix of spices! Try making a reservation on the app open tables a couple days before because the wait times are insane."
Margaret M.,"San Francisco, CA",6/20/2017,5.0,We were visiting from out of town tonight and we all had exceptional meals! Everything was delicious! My husband had chicken and waffles and I had the Ruben- both phenomenal. Our server Jose was incredibly friendly and helpful as well.
Brittany H.,"Chicago, IL",7/7/2017,4.0,"Food was good, atmosphere and service were good, and we loved the concept, however:1. The menu is WAYYY too big with way too many categories! There were easily 50 food items to choose from and just as many drinks on the other side, and a separate menu for desserts wth probably another 10 options. It's a very overwhelming experience as a guest. 2. If you want to do a little bit of everything, scale down the portions and do small plates so you can try a few things and not have that fear of ordering the wrong thing. 3. If you're going to do local, farm fresh, you've got to have a seasonal menu. No way you can get all these things year round and have them taste good. Overall, a good experience with a promising concept, but could use a little refinement."
Rebecca L.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",1/15/2017,5.0,"First off, make reservations. This place was packed when we arrived and we were pretty damn happy we did the right thing and made reservations. On that same token, make sure you're entire party arrives on time or you will not be seated. Not a problem we encountered but overheard (quick tangent: places this busy don't have time for you to sit and wait for that late individual and wasting time for the establishment to make money because you don't want to order till everyone is there, we can be decent folks and not give people who work there shit for doing their jobs)Chicken and waffles. My gosh. Delicious. Chicken crispy. Waffles cooked to perfection. And it comes with mac and cheese. Who doesn't like mac and cheese? And if you don't, try this mac and cheese. It'll make you a believer. The additional side we ordered was the sweet potato and I don't know what's on top of it, but it complimented the entire slide nicely.Eggs Benedict with crab. The egg was perfect. It even looked pretty. I'm a fan of seafood so I liked how much crab was on it. They also serve it different ways, pick your favorite!! The side I picked for this was the leek hash browns. Had plenty of flavor for being paired with leeks, but I love ketchup... We ordered the cornbread as an appetizer and it came out a little after our meals had already been brought out, but the excellence of the texture and presentation made the lateness of this dish acceptable. It came with this honey/whipped butter/coarse salt sprinkle concoction in a condiment dish. Excellent.We got mimosas and they looked like Mountain Dew, but they did not skimp on prosecco (it wasn't champagne). You won't be disappointed."
Makayla H.,"Peachtree City, GA",7/7/2017,5.0,"Founding Farmers was my favorite place I ate while in DC. We were here during the 4th of July weekend, and I would definitely recommend making reservations in advance, as the wait would get up to 2 hours. Don't leave without ordering the cornbread appetizer- IT IS DELICIOUS and enough to share with a few people.I had the Yankee Pot Roast, and it was fantastic- super tender and melt in your mouth.Overall, don't miss Founding Farmers while in DC. It's worth every penny!"
Lena A.,"Santa Monica, CA",12/8/2015,4.0,"First of all, the name is just adorable. Second, they make everything themselves: sodas, whiskey, pasta, bread, I really do mean everything. The ambiance has an industrial feel with a hint of cozy rustic which I really liked. There's also a little waiting area with books to keep you entertained as you wait. If you don't have reservations, you will wait! So make reservations. Service was friendly and attentive, but coming in as a walk in they really stressed the time limit we had at the communal table and we felt rushed throughout our lunch. (Again, make reservations!) Here's what we had: Brie farm bread (5/5 stars): delicious toasted bread topped with creamy Brie, sweet onion jam, and apple slices. So good! Goat cheese ravioli (5/5 stars): the waitress said this would be the best goat cheese ravioli I would ever have and while it was really good, what really stood out was the chicken. Two thinly pounded breasts pan seared to perfection almost to the point of having just the slightest hint of fried taste. Add the butternut squash purée and this was an extremely enjoyable dish. Short ribs (4/5 stars): my dad and husband both got this as the waitress highly recommended it and they both really enjoyed it. They said it was well marinated and melted in their mouths. Their only gripe was that some pieces were too fatty. Sides: mashed potatoes and pearl pasta (3/5 stars): nothing special, slightly flavorless. Mashed potatoes came cold. A note on the bathrooms: must go and read all the quotes on the wall! For the ladies there is advice on how to properly eat soup, letting a guy court you, and never turning down wine. For the gentlemen there's a tutorial on how to write a love letter. Adorable! Overall solid lunch! Wishing they'd open one in California!"
Leen B.,"Vienna, VA",8/16/2016,4.0,"I've had a much better experience here than I did at their new Tyson's branch. I really liked the location, and I would recommend visiting this place early before it gets packed (any time before 5pm I guess). We didn't really make a reservation because we went around 3-4 pm and it wasn't busy at that time. I liked the vibe of the place, and how it's bright due to the sun shining through all the windows. We ordered the devil-ish eggs (classic) which were really good, the famous fried chicken & waffles which was great, and the fried chicken salad (I replaced the bacon with avocados) which was delicious!! Also, the service was fantastic: our waitress was friendly, and the food didn't take long to arrive. Finally, the price was quite reasonable!"
Elizabeth B.,"San Francisco, CA",7/7/2017,5.0,"Great food, great service! Came for my husband's birthday of 30 people. Did not have to wait long for food. Everyone's food order was correct. Did not like them charging to cut his cake, but still was nice for them to do it."
Taya T.,"Honolulu, HI",4/18/2017,4.0,"Fantastic food! I had the Egg, spinach and mushroom scramble with a side of Leek Hash and Toasted bread. The hash was smoky and seasoned perfectly. I also had a waffle with strawberries and cream. Very light and enjoyable! My server was very prompt and attentive. We had water and coffee almost immediately after being seated.The reason why I'm unable to give all 5 stars is the way we were greeted or not greeted at all. As we walked into the restaurant there was a person to the right of the entrance typing something on a computer. He didn't even look up to acknowledge us. I stood in front of him, said ""hello"" and asked for his attention, however he still didn't even look up. My husband then approached him. He was asked whether we had a reservation and informed that it would be a 10 minute wait. I couldn't understand why we had to wait - the place looked half empty. There were two gentlemen who seemed to have been waiting for some time, but my husband and I were offered to be seated first. I pointed that out. Overall, my impression was that there was lack of attention to detail throughout the restaurant. The bathrooms were messy, the elevator leading to the second floor was used as storage, etc. Most importantly, some of the staff missed to recognise what really matters - the customers!"
Felicia D.,"Washington, DC",12/17/2016,5.0,"I'm told this is a D.C. favorite! I stopped by Founding Farmers for the second time recently since I needed something that was close to the airport. It was much less crowded this time around - daytime, weekday as opposed to evening, weekend. Cool. I started with the El Presidente, a cocktail recommended by my server. I had to take it easy because well, I was driving, had my nephew as precious cargo and needed to fight rush hour traffic soon. Perfect choice. Not too strong. Not too sweet. I went for the cornbread again, because one must always go for the cornbread. I don't know if it's just the cornbread or if it's the honey butter+cornbread combo. Either way, my tummy says yes. The roasted tomato soup was everything I needed on a cold, rainy day. The bread served with it was delicious, too. If you can tell, I'm not afraid of carbs. I also had the balsamic blue burger. I'm certain that's not the official name, but let's just roll with it. Of course I was stuffed after everything else, so I only made it through about 3-4 bites. So good. It did reheat beautifully and made for the perfect midnight snack."
Mike C.,"Arlington, VA",4/17/2017,3.0,"Visited Founding Farmers a couple of months ago on a Tuesday night with my sister. We didn't have a reservation so I decided to head their ahead of time to wait in line. For a table for two, the hostess told me that the wait was over an hour. I waited an hour and a half in the end. The food was decent and nothing really special. We started with one of their farm breads, then I had a burger, and my sister had ravioli. The food/service and portions were good... but for as long as I had to wait, you think they were giving stuff away. Don't bother going here unless you make a reservation."
Zomorrod R.,"Foggy Bottom, Washington, DC",1/26/2017,5.0,"Love this place! I go to GW everyday so it's a very convincing place for me to hang out! LOVE the food! I'm in love with the corn bread! So fresh and amazing, and chicken waffle is also my favorite to order there. Definitely try it!"
Fritz L.,"Huntington, NY",3/7/2017,3.0,"maybe it was my bad choice, stuffed French toast.  Whats wrong with ""conventional"" challah bread French toast?  Maybe it offends the natives.It was tasty but too rich.  Pleasant fast wait staff.Perhaps dinner is a better choice."
Nguyen H.,"Paris, France",7/6/2017,4.0,"The food and services can be good in a less crowded day, but in a place that long queue and chaos started to be out of control, you cannot expect full enjoyment. The founders should focus more on management to maintain the quality of the restaurant. If so, it will sure be a worth to go place."
Marian P.,"Jacksonville, FL",6/27/2017,5.0,"Great service, food and concept! Everything about Founding Farmers is fresh and delicious. We will definitely be returning for breakfast."
Lo S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/6/2017,4.0,"I would really love to give this place 3.5 stars, but I am giving them the extra .5 because I hate to give less for a petty reason. Plus they make up for it in the farm to table concept and anything involving sustainable practices makes me super happy.Being a New Yorker I am not used to ridiculously long waits for restaurants, it's just something we don't do. If I am told I have a 1-2 hour wait, I simply choose from one of the 50 other restaurants the current area of the city I am in has to offer. DC does not have that option. On a Friday or Saturday night if you don't have a reservation you are just out of luck.Anyway, on to the food! I've been a patron for dinner (after waiting 2 hours with my dad and his girlfriend which we proceeded to drink through) and lunch on a workday.Our dinner was absolutely delicious. We got the kettle corn pot (a must try, I don't even like popcorn and this stuff is the best), I got the shrimp & grits, my dad got the scallops meuniere, and my dad's girlfriend got the butternut squash ravioli. After trying a few bites of everyone's food ;) I couldn't decide which I liked best! The food is on point.For lunch I went with my two girl friends. We actually had to fight people in the bar for seats that we waited for (the guy who thought he was waiting before us actually called my friend a b**** for grabbing the seat when these people stood up) and the three of us shared two chairs. I was not kidding - it gets aggressive in here with the waiting.We tried the fried green tomatoes which were good.. but being someone who has tried A LOT of southern food since I used to live in NC.. I thought the breading was far too heavy and they were lacking a bit of flavor.For the life of me, I can't remember what my friends got, but they really enjoyed their food!I got the ahi tuna poke salad - probably one of the best ahi salads I have EVER had. The dressing and all toppings worked perfectly and it was perfectly filling.Make sure you make a reservation in advance!"
Halina M.,"New York, NY",1/5/2017,5.0,"Delicious! The service was good and the entrees are very reasonably priced. I got the hangover hash (really good) and my friend got the farmer's breakfast with the chicken sausage. Both were tasty. We also got a side of bacon, but I don't think it was worth it - three strips for $6. I'd definitely come back."
Jazmyne M.,"Alexandria, VA",8/23/2017,3.0,"The food was phenomenal. But the personal interaction with the servers was awful. We were a party of 10 and felt like we had the most pretentious, condescending servers. They had no interest to give knowledge of the menu, they were impatient and rude when we said we weren't ready to order. They didn't check on us. Kinda sucks when you're in such a nice environment but you feel like YOURE the problem."
Casey R.,"Washington, DC",8/23/2017,1.0,Waited for over twenty minutes at the bar without being greeted or offered water. Tried to grab one of the bartenders attention multiple times. Eventually got fed up and went somewhere else. Absolutely terrible service. Will not be back.
Liv K.,"Sunnyvale, CA",12/1/2015,4.0,"You know that chic, attractive design style of cold industrial tempered with rustic warmth? I like that look and this place has it in spades. We stopped by with my colleague for breakfast before he headed off to work. We arrived shortly after 7AM on a Tuesday morning. The host was friendly and quickly showed us to a booth. Nice selection of breakfast foods, from sweet things like pancakes, waffles and French toast to savory items like benedicts, hashes and scrambles. Basic breakfast includes two eggs, sausage or bacon, toast and a choice of hash browns, grits, farmers salad, seasonal fruit or tomatoes. The prices at breakfast range from $5 for oatmeal with fixings to $14 for crab benedict.I ordered drip coffee and the crab eggs benedict, $14, with a side of grits. Coffee was the standard drip coffee, a-ok. The poached eggs were a bit overcooked so I was disappointed I didn't get that #yolkporn runny yolk sexiness dripping onto the crab and bread. The crab meat was really good, tender and delish. The English muffin was perfectly toasted to a satisfying dark golden brown crunch on the edges. The hollandaise sauce was salted to the point of ""season to taste...salt"", so I resorted to eating alternating forkfuls of benedict and spoonfuls of grits. My colleague ordered a Coke. It took a while for the Coke to arrive. The server came by and explained the delay occurred because she had to get the Coke from the bar. Well, imagine our surprise when she returned with a can of Coke! When she said she had to go to the bar to get the Coke, we imagined it would be Coke dispensed from a bar soda gun.The service was a bit lacking and lukewarm. The hostess was quick to seat us, but the rest of the service was slow. The server could have been friendlier. It's a service industry job, after all. On a side note, I appreciated the black cloth napkins. The white ones leave white fuzz on everything.Good food and coffee. Best if you're not in any sort of time crunch."
Glenn S.,"New York, NY",12/19/2016,4.0,"From the Steak & Enchiladas, to the excellent breakfast menu. You're in good hands. This is a great place. More so, you'd expect food on this level to be really expensive, but have no worry, good prices,.excellent service, & beautiful atmosphere. MANY HUGS & KISSES TO MY WIFE WHO FOUND THIS PLACE FOR US ....."
Bella P.,"Gilbert, AZ",5/4/2017,5.0,"This place was sooooo good! Nice atmosphere, delicious food. Price was decent. It was a nice refuge from the rain and the service was wonderful."

Allison S.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/13/2015,4.0,"I came here twice in one trip-- once for brunch and once for a to go lunch.The brunch was the better visit. We came early on Saturday and didn't have a wait (I did make reservations first) but it definitely was packed by the time we left. The place has the BEST beignets I've ever had. They are light, airy, and fluffy, and so good with all three dipping sauces. I seriously couldn't decide which one to dip. The crab cake benedict was average, a little too peppery and the English muffin was a little stiff. The French press coffee was a nice option to share. There were families, friends, college students, and us visitors all in the mix.For lunch I had the ahi tuna salad to go. It was a big serving (box was stuffed to the top). The tuna itself was fresh and the veggies had a nice crunch, but the onion was raw and pungent and unfortunately mixed in the salad so I couldn't pick it out. They also don't provide to go utensils which was disappointing."
Debi R.,"Spartanburg, SC",4/2/2017,5.0,Before arriving in DC I found a few restaurants I wanted to try. This was at top of my list for Sunday Brunch. Reading reviews revealed reservations were the best idea. So I made reservations couple of days ahead. 100% good plan! (If you arrive as soon as they open you may not have to wait).   We had the famous beignets to begin. My husband had the build your own breakfast and I had blueberry pancakes. (Loaded with blueberries and topped with blueberry butter) You can also get a pot of delicious coffee or try their lattes.  Everything was better than expected. Too much food. Definitely do the beignets! (Better than in New Orleans) service was wonderful. Hardest thing was leaving & getting through the crowd waiting at the door! Best breakfast in Washington.
Farheen Q.,"Baltimore, MD",7/24/2016,5.0,"Plenty of parking, large restaurant. A lot of people were waiting in the front when we walked in. We had called ahead for a reservation for 3 the same day and could only get 8:45pm for dinner (which was more than I could find on OpenTable - only 5pm or 10pm) and they got us seated in less than 10minutes.Restaurant is boisterous and casual but nice. Cocktails are great, many are made of their own housemade liquor (gin, pisco, and rye). My husband had the rye sour and I had a gin drink called the ""daisy"" or something, both were good. For dinner, our companion had the roast chicken, I had the shrimp & grits, and my husband had the scallops with butternut squash risotto. Everything was delicious. The shrimp and grits had a sauce with a kick to it which I really loved, and some sausage. We were too stuffed for dessert but everything was delicious and I would love to return."
Tara M.,"Orange Park, FL",1/23/2017,5.0,"Went there on a Sunday for brunch and it was packed! We were told the wait was an hour and a half so we stalked the bar area but lo and behold we were called after about 20 minutes! After being seated our order was taken, drinks and entree served within minutes of sitting down so two thumbs up for quick service. Started with beignets and 3 different sauces...DELISH, shrimp/grits, and chicken/waffles were all fresh and delicious!! Great spot for brunch!"
Elizabeth L.,"Fullerton, CA",7/23/2016,3.0,"Nothing really stood out since I can't even remember what we tried when we visited this place in DC.  Service was mediocre. Even with reservation, we were not seated right away and it felt like the server forgot about us since we were seated in the corner of the restaurant. The person who poured our water was the one who reminded our server of our existence. Additionally, the staff did not properly us into our open table reservations on the system. I noticed this upon my return back to California. Overall, since I am alive and I remember not being food poisoned I would give this place a 2.5-3."
Kristine T.,"San Diego, CA",7/23/2016,4.0,"We made reservations for 8:45am but the sign said they opened at 9:00am. Luckily, they did in fact open at 8:45am. People were already standing outside waiting! Ethan was our waiter and he was really great. Fast and friendly!Beignets - I've never had a beignet before so I have nothing to compare them. Regardless, these were delicious! Came out hot and fresh. They were soft, moist and flaky. It reminded me of a donut/funnel cake/croissant. My fiancé loved these. He was already full from his entree but couldn't leave without finishing the beignets. Chicken and Waffles - The chicken was a lot better than from our dinner last night at Central Michel. Nicely battered and moist. Waffle was huge and fluffy. The gravy on the side was a nice touch. Roasted Veggie Scramble w/ Chicken Sausage - This came with your choice of a side and bread. I went with the hash browns and multigrain toast. Scramble but good but nothing mind blowing. Something you could throw together at home. Hash browns were generic as well as their toast.Overalls, solid breakfast place. Definitely get the beignets when you come!"
Marz B.,"Fredericksburg, VA",6/9/2017,4.0,I enjoyed this place went with a few friends and the food was great music just low enough to enjoy without drowning out discussion. i'd defiantly go again if it was closer
Angelina M.,"Chelsea, MA",1/23/2016,4.0,"Mmm mmm and mmm. Brunch=delish. My brother and I went for brunch on MLK morning. He had been for dinner before while visiting DC so we gave brunch a try.  We waited for about 15-20 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad at 10am.  They sat us at a long table shared by several other guests.  Of course I ordered coffee first! They said the French press coffee was out (not sure how this happened at 10am) so we ordered just a cup of Joe.  The coffee was a bit pricey at $4 a cup but was good and free refills.I ordered the waffle with strawberries and sweet cream alongside an order of bacon.  The best part of the waffle was actually the cream! Of course the waffle itself was good too, but nothing that blew my mind.  The bacon was nice and crispy and had great flavor.My brother ordered the lobster benedict.... try this! I wasn't expected so much lobster on the English muffins so that was a nice surprise.  The eggs were cooked just right and it made me wish I ordered it for myself.The service was fine but it was a bit breezy where we were sitting for some reason.  It looked like they had a great selection on the bar so it would be a nice night time spot or date night."
Sonchari M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",11/30/2015,3.0,"Decent food, good company, but crappy service.My best friends and I met up for a brunch and didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant wasn't as packed, so we got seated pretty quickly. After ordering, and eating our food, the wait staff kept trying to take the food away even though we clearly werent done eating. After that, the waiter comes by and says, ""oh by the way, you guys have ten mins left."" My friends and I look at each other like HUH?whats he talking about? So apparently if you dont make a reservation, walk-ins are restricted to a time limit, which was never communicated to us. When we told the waiter this, I guess he spoke with the manager and the manager said we could stay for longer. But even then, the waiter kept pushing us to clear the table. We got asked by different wait staff 3 or 4 times if we wanted dessert and when my friends and I said no, they started to take my drink away!!! Thats when we had enough and left. Food was good, nothing to rave about honestly. I think there is a hype for this place because they make everything themselves and its all organic and all that crap but the service is what really brought down the rating."
Jasleen K.,"Chapel Hill, NC",6/30/2016,5.0,"This place was hands down the best place we ate in DC! After seeing how many reviews there were we had to check it out, and made a reservation via open table. We were sat at our time but man the restaurant was so busy around lunch time I don't think we would have been sat without a reservation. The chicken pot pie was out of this world. My dad is a pot pie fan and he said this was the best pot pie we had ever had in our lives. I tried it and I def agreed!! If I went back this is what I would have ordered! The chicken and waffles was delicious!!! The chicken was so moist and the skin not crazy greasy or oily. The BBQ ribs were also fantastic. Sides we ate that were awesome: red potatoes, green beans, mint watermelon. The ""worlds best milkshake"" was really THE WORLDS BEST MILKSHAKE!! We had the bananas fosters, and it was amazing! I HIGHLY recommend this place!!!"
Kiva M.,"Washington, DC",7/21/2016,5.0,"Founding farmers is one of my favorite spots to bring people when they come to visit me in DC because everyone always loves it! The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious. Yo absolutely must make a reservation. The few times I have been there without one, I have waited at least 45 minutes for a table. I have never tried anything I didn't like!!"
Shameika H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",6/13/2016,5.0,I will be back. My friends suggested it when we were in DC. I had never been before but I'm glad they dragged me to it. We made a reservation and arrived a little early. They seated us upstairs during the time I requested. We had a great waiter. I forgot his name (I'm bad with names forgive me) but he went above and beyond to explain to me the great facts of the business. I ordered great food with the suggestions of our waiter. I already know what I'm getting next time I go.
Viking W.,"Alexandria, VA",7/4/2017,5.0,"This place elevates what a casual meal should and can be.  From start to finish meaning from starters to dessert (and the inviting warm cookies - typically I don't order dessert) everything was great.   Claire, our server, welcomed us and took care of my party and me. The food was fantastic. To be honest, my guests we looking at the menu and saying it was plain. Though I haven't been to FF before, the explanation of the quality of Farm to Table is what sold me coming to Founding Farmers (in DC). As we tasted the starters (corn bread and devilish deviled eggs) and received our entrees (Seafood Bucatini and Glazed Salmon) - I didn't hear the words of plain anymore since I selected FF for my daughter's birthday. All I saw were smiles. Great job and I will be back.  Make reservations - walk-ins were waiting for an hour."
Ruobin W.,"Stony Brook, NY",12/5/2016,5.0,"Deceptively good. The food comes out looking kinda disappointing and regular, but it's actually very tasty. Chicken and waffles: chicken was tender, juicy and fried perfectly; gravy was rich but not too heavy; waffle was just crispy. All good. The farmer's breakfast is also pretty tasty, though I don't understand why since it's just the regular egg, sausage, toast. Everything's just high quality I guess?"
Brandon C.,"Kingston Springs, TN",7/4/2017,5.0,Beautiful restaurant with great service and perfect food! The chicken and waffles was great as well as the green beans and the fresh mac and cheese! Everything we had was great! I will go back if ever in the area!
Greg T.,"Springdale, MD",5/28/2017,1.0,"Now normally I always have a great time at founding farmers but this particular night.... Tonight actually... May 27th... me & a friend came to the bar... and waited a solid 30-45 mins @ the bar. People were being ignorant at the fact that they didn't want us to have a seat at the bar after I asked two people AFTER they paid their tab. So we ordered two drinks absolute & lemonade (which was all Ice ""literally"" in a small glass, in which typically it's in a tall glass) my friend ordered a sidecar and it was too sour. So after waiting 45 minutes, 2 terrible drinks, paid my tab, we left. Safe to say I'll email the corporate. How as a bartender to allow people to sit Hours at the bar and just converse without ordering anything & it's packed. Or am I in the wrong?"
Dorothy L.,"Montville, NJ",1/19/2016,5.0,My friend recommended me to come here for breakfast and I am glad I did... Their food is so fresh and delicious... And the service is extraordinary!!! We ordered stuffed French toast and chicken waffle... And the best combo you can get!!! Sweet from the French toast and salty/spicy from the chicken... The eggs!!! Oh man was so smooth and silky... You will have to try for yourself... Did I mentioned the service was awesome?!?
Teja S.,"Chantilly, VA",5/23/2017,4.0,"It seems like most people visit Founding Farmers for brunch but my sister and I decided to come here for lunch on a sweltering hot day in the district. The ambiance was casual but classy, which seems contradictory but if you step inside, you'll know what I mean. I made reservations and we were a few minutes late but got seated about 5 minutes after arriving. We wanted to order some of the signature breads on the menu but were turned off from those when our server described them as 3 pieces of bread each cut into 3 more pieces for $9. Essentially a dollar per bite size. I ordered the vegetable and avocado sandwich and it was refreshing - it tasted like a very well made salad in between slices of really yummy bread. Perfect meal for the hot day. I got a side of mashed potatoes and those were some of the best I've ever had.My sister ordered the sun dried tomato and shrimp bucatini, which most people recommend and that was good, but I'm just not a fan of seafood. The noodles are on the thicker side (probably because they're hand made). Service was great - I thought I lost something at the restaurant and when I called, people were on the call to see to my issue right away."
LaKisha B.,"Washington, DC",6/10/2016,4.0,"This has easily become one of my favorite places to eat!I love the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant. The first time that I went, I had the glazed salmon, whipped potatoes and collard greens. Omg everything was cooked to perfection! I ended up taking leftovers and everything still tasted fresh. The service was ok. Our waiter was impatient and we felt rushed at times. The second time that I went, I had the prime rib dip sandwich with whipped potatoes. I was bummed that the collard greens were only seasonal! I was craving for some lol. My lunch was delicious nonetheless! The service was fast and our waitress was kind and helpful. The only reason why I don't give this place five stars is because of the service. I felt rushed during both of my visits. I understand they are very busy but I hated feeling like I was being rushed. I had food on my plate and was constantly asked if I was finished. That was quite annoying. I should be able to order my food, take my time eating it and not be rushed so the next person can be seated."
Erik N.,"Washington, DC",2/26/2017,3.0,"This is not a good weekend brunch spot. This place is unorganized! We called yesterday to get a brunch reservation; they said ""no, show up in-person and wait."" So we did. We have been waiting for an hour and a half to get a table for two and they are seating people who were not here before us. ....After eating here, I can say that the food is not worth the long wait. Furthermore, this is not a place to meet friends because you all will be reminded constantly to hurry because there is a wait. Once we leave, we will not come back nor recommend."
Katie S.,"Springfield, VA",6/6/2016,4.0,"I now understand why everyone I know raves about this place. My girlfriends and I secured a reservation for 10 on Saturday night for a bachlorette party and had the best time. Service was a little slow, but with so many of us, and the restaurant being so busy (even at 9 pm there was still an hour wait for dinner!), I feel like they did a really nice job. Our server was super sweet and the food was fantastic.  We split a bunch of aps and the standouts to me were the seafood deviled eggs and the bacon wrapped dates.  For my main, I ordered the lobster mac and cheese-which is just basically two breaded lobster tails-on a bed of the creamiest, gooiest, most rich mac and cheese I think I have ever had in my whole life. It was intense to say the least!  My best friend traded me some of her amazing pork chop and mashed potatoes (holy hell those were good!) for a few bites of my pasta, so I was very glad to have something to break up the richness. They have a decent cocktail list, although tbh, what I ordered wasn't particularly memorable. I feel like we went bad by not ordering cornbread, so I guess I will just have to come back sooner, rather than later, to remedy that oversight."
Jeff K.,"Anaheim, CA",11/23/2015,2.0,"Wake up people... founding farmers is not that great.  i'm really surprised that on a weekday at 1:30 there was still a wait to get in.  Luckily we had reservations, but still.  damn.this place reminds me or a yardhouse/cheesecake factory or bj's.  nothing special about it.  when we got there, we were escorted upstairs.  we got seated and they told us that a server would be with us shortly.  he was, and he took our order and asked if we wanted anything to drink.  we wanted water, and i swear it took him around 8-10 mins to just get water.  ok, wtf.  next bad thing was that the food we ordered...1) chicken and waffles: this dish came out cold.  we had to send it back to have him reheat it or make it new.  i bet money they just reheated it. 2) blue cheese and bacon burger:  nothing wrong with the burger, but as for the sides... i asked for the server's recommendation, and he suggested lemon green beans.  he brought out potato salad, and i asked him where the green beans were, and he had the audacity to tell me that i ordered potato salad.  dude.... you're the one who told me to get the green beans.3) fried green tomatoes: this dish came out fucking fast.  like after we put in the order, it was out in like 2-3 mins.  which leads me to believe they don't make it fresh.  no way, you can bread and deep fry something in that amount of time. luckily, they comped the chicken and waffles... but still.  i left with a bad taste in my mouth after dining here. if i ever go back to DC, i will not come back to this place."
Sujan P.,"New York, NY",1/29/2017,4.0,Chanté and oscar were very accommodating of our situation. I was visiting from New York and arrived earlier than the rest my party however Shante was very kind to seek me and allowed me to wait for the rest of my party. Oskar was very kind to keep us in the know regarding a party that had a reservation after us.Food overall was very good. Pancakes are very light and fluffy. The fried chicken was perfectly spiced. Daisy farmer or something like that was really well-made. Overall an enjoyable experience.
Tarra D.,"Montclair, NJ",6/15/2017,5.0,"This place is awesome the food is sooo good. Whenever I'm in town I come here. I would suggest to call ahead as its very popular so it's busy. My favs are the chicken a d waffles, skillet cornbread and dessert the red velvet cake."
C L.,"Norwalk, CT",7/3/2017,4.0,"It's not easy to pump out consistently good fresh food at the volume the the Founding Farmers do during a weekend brunch.  I visited for the first time this weekend and was very impressed.  It is a madhouse at the front as dozens of patrons wait for tables. Upstairs is a bit more quite than downstairs.  The only food complaint was that they used the flattop to ""grill"" the bottoms of the english muffins for my eggs benedict and in the process created a nearly impenetrable skin that even my steak knife could not cut....  But other than that, we had a great meal."
Liz G.,"Telluride, CO",7/16/2016,5.0,"Cornbread, scallops, and butternut ravioli were all awesome!!! We started with Cucumber Delight cocktails and the cornbread skillet - yum!!! We didn't have a reservation we just got lucky and found a seat at the bar. Make a reservation! The prices are great, the portions are generous and the food is good. Eat here while you're in DC."
Ryan F.,"Spring Hill, FL",3/15/2017,5.0,"We stopped here our first time in DC after seeing some amazing reviews on yelp. Founding Farmers did not disappoint! It was amazing! I think this is honestly one of the top 10 restaurants I've ever eaten at. I loved all the dishes we tried. The shrimp and grits was great! It wasn't a traditional shrimp and grits like some we have had where we live in FL but I really like to see different spins on traditional dishes. My wife had fried chicken and waffles, which was very good as well! The skillet cornbread is a must have when you stop here as well! I can't wait to return here if we happen to stop in DC again. (I would even consider making a trip just to stop here!)"
Amirah A.,"Washington, DC",1/3/2016,4.0,"Go here now and get the chicken and waffles. It WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! I've been here a couple of times and always go back for the same dish. Came with a few friends from out of town and I convinced our entire table of 6 to order the same dish. The chicken is juicy and moist and they give you two humongous pieces. The waffles are light and buttery and the Mac and cheese is just as good as what you would expect from a mom and pop's store in the south. The sweet potatoes side makes you go back to thanksgiving dinner. Go here just for this dish. I would assume everything else on the menu is good too. 4 stars for service - there seems to be a disconnect between the hostess and front desk, I've been told my table was ready and then have had to wait for additional time."
Tom O.,"Huntingtown, MD",3/14/2017,5.0,"This place lives up to the hype!  Our first time there and each of us was impressed with our meals.  Everything was fresh and perfectly prepared.  While they are know for their Fired Chicken & Waffles, we opted for some other dishes like the steak enchilada and lamb.  All was excellent.  The cocktails we also unique and worth the money.  Hints... Definitely get reservations.  Great place to eat before a Kennedy Center show (easy walk to the Kennedy Center Shuttle by Foggy Bottom Metro)."
Ginny C.,"Melville, NY",7/2/2017,1.0,"We made lunch reservation and we thought we scored and  hoping to be inspired  for farm to table ingredients.  Ordered farmers platter, looked like a plate of mystery meat and tasted like mystery meat. Bland and no flavor and chips were overdone or shall I say burnt?  I had Chicken and waffle, the waffles were like  cake consistency with no crisp to it and soggy.  The fried chicken was just fried and had no flavor, green been like it was last season and not fresh.  I was hoping to have a fabulous lunch but so disappointed from the hype of farm to fresh.  Is this a chain or have I been duped?  I give it half star!!!!!"
Rich G.,"London, United Kingdom",6/6/2016,3.0,"Not a bad place for some food, but nothing special. We came here as it was repeatedly mentioned in our guide book. Tried just walking in on the Saturday but it was an hour wait, booked online later and got a brunch slot for Sunday! Yay!So, I'm British, I love a good queue. That said, I was getting a teensy bit antsy after queuing for 15 minutes despite having a reservation, with crowds of people milling around me... Maybe I was just hangry. The food is ok, nothing to write home about. I ordered the steak and eggs, with toast. The (ranch) steak was ok, but a bit tough. The eggs were fine but the toast was... Well it was fried in oil and there was no butter, maybe it's how things are normally done here but I like my toast toasted... With the option of butter and no adder oil. The blue cheese burger was bland, with minimal blue cheese, but apparently the mash was good! The chef's pick cocktail was nice! Small, but nice. Good list of drinks so it could make a great boozy brunch place. Generally this seems like a good place if you want something filling and basic. I reckon you can find somewhere better though if you look around."
Tammy L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",7/13/2016,4.0,"MAKE RESERVATIONS!!PEPPERJACK WINGS!!!! One of the best wings I've ever had.  The table next to us saw us digging in and saw the looks on our faces.  They decided to order it too!Shrimp n grits - so tasty but I think the portion of grits is a little lacking.  It can definitely save the dish if they could just double the amount of grits.  Otherwise, the flavor was spectacular!Chicken pot pie - the flavor was amazing!  However, it came with a large biscuit that was so dense and hard.  It ended up absorbing most of the liquid from my dish. :("
Cindy T.,"New York, NY",5/29/2017,2.0,I'm guessing the reviews are mostly for dinner. Brunch was underwhelming. The pastrami hash was very bland. I could only get through half of it.

Updated review",2.0,I used to love this place as a vegetarian during brunch. Was not at all impressed as a vegan during dinner.
Casey S.,"Pinehurst, NC",7/5/2016,4.0,"My friend in DC took me to Founding Farmers, labeling it as the quintessential DC brunch spot. If I wanted to feel like a true DC girl, this was the place to eat. I'm a fan of hype and a good gimmick. Bring me to Shake Shack and Momofuku and I'll fan girl with the rest of them. But it was only until after I had the food that I truly understood the hype around it. I found the food and the service to be excellent. We made reservations a week before and were seated 10 minutes after checking in - that kind of sucked but the front entryway was a mad house. I was disappointed to find out that they were out of peach purée after I ordered a Bellini but the mimosa was a fine replacement. After ordering our food, it came out super fast. While waiting we were entertained by looking at our neighbors food (you sit alarmingly close to one another.) The beignets were great, the poached eggs cooked to perfection. If you're into gimmicks (no shame) check this place out. There's a reason why it is so popular in DC."
Meg L.,"Washington, DC",4/8/2017,1.0,"Decided to try the place despite the warnings about the bad service.  Went on a Saturday evening around 5:30 pm when there were few customers.  Spent the first ten minutes watching the table next to use trying to make an order while being told of things the restaurant was out of and suffering from bad service.  Then two servers starting fighting over who would wait on our table. The bad server won and we suffered through a server whose accent was so think we could not understand what he was saying other than he kept telling us we did not understand. The floor manager made excuses when we complain and seem more interested talking to his friends at the bar than keeping the place running.  The place does not seem to know what it wants to do.  If it wants to be trendy, lose the meatloaf.  If it wants to be more upscale, it needs to upgrade the service.We finally decided after receiving our food to pay for our drinks and leave. it took 45 minutes for our order to come and when it did it was cold; not just one part, all of it was cold. Needless to say i have received better service at Denny's and McDonald's. I do not plan on giving this place a second chance. I live in DC and will make sure my family and friends do not come here."
Kimberly T.,"San Jose, CA",7/9/2016,3.0,"Founding Farmers is one of the most popular places in DC, though I'm not sure why exactly. I went three times and while It's decent food, I don't think there's anything special about it. It's just normal American-style food. It's also SUPER crowded so getting a table takes a long time.The three times I went, I got the egg white vegetable scramble, eggs benedict, and the ahi tuna salad.Overall, it's fine but nothing special."
Supriya S.,"Manhattan, NY",3/25/2017,4.0,"This place was an amazing find. Found a table that opened up on Open Table at 12:15PM and we pounced at the opportunity. We were seated in 5 minutes and started our brunch with Bloody Marys. They were one of the best we've had and was the perfect amount of hot! We got the Founding farmers breakfast with Scrambled eggs, bacon, salad and the multigrain toast. The girl at the table next to us shouted out that the blueberry pancake was really good. We couldn't help ourselves and went ahead and ordered a full stack of the blueberry pancakes. They were really good. It was the perfect brunch before we headed out for the Cherry Blossom festival!"
Ames F.,"Dallas, TX",2/16/2017,5.0,"This place has a good vibe with Great food but an extremely long wait. The mixology drink list is on point, the one thing that stood out that I could order each time would be the amazing bacon appetizer."
Happy M.,"Manhasset, NY",8/21/2017,5.0,Very family friendly. Reasonably priced. Full of flavor. Drinks were amazing and service top notch. Felt very comfortable dining with children. My extremely picky child tried a few new foods including corn bread. We had an amazing experience while visiting D.C. for a family vacation.
Colleen S.,"Paris, France",8/21/2017,2.0,"Could not have been more disappointed in this place. The service was seriously terrible. I will say the entire staff is hustling around and working, but I couldn't get ANYONE's attention. Everything brought to our table, you could tell had been sitting in the kitchen waiting for our server. The cappuccino looked half full as all the foam had disappeared from sitting so long. Then she dropped it to us and ran, without sugar. By the time she was able to bring sugar, the whole thing was cold. My hash browns came out cold and barely done, while our other plate's was well done and hot. The crabs egg benedict had some icky crab, which is so bizarre for the area, and the bit of hollandaise sauce was dried to the egg, again a sign of waiting to be picked up, and worst of all, the yolks of the eggs were SOLID. The orange juice was good and the french toast was amazing, but I have never been so annoyed by a Sunday brunch in my life. This place is so hyped and people will continue to go because of that, but I will not recommend it or go back."
Phuong B.,"Downey, CA",3/6/2017,5.0,"Really great, healthy farm to table foodNathan, our server, was so amazing and friendly. The perfect host to take care of your dining experience. Also my husband had a business meeting here and Nathan took care of them then. Their experience was great and it was a successful meeting."
Alice A.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",8/11/2017,2.0,Food is great however the service is super slow. I have been to this location 5 times and the service is poor. The crab Benedict is great but not worth the wait.
Amy V.,"Albuquerque, NM",7/5/2016,4.0,"Made a reservation through Open Table and was immediately seated upon arrival. The food was good, certainly fresh, but nothing that blew me out of the water. The service was fantastic, but for the price, I think it deserves 4/5 stars."
AJ R.,"Mount Vernon, NY",1/16/2017,5.0,"The service is stellar and the food, oh my. I know brunch/breakfast are not complicated but my steak & eggs melted in my mouth. My Bloody Mary was spicy and well-Tito vodka'd to my satisfaction. It's good, popular and you need to make a reservation (even then you may need to wait 10 mins) well-worn the wait!!"
Raha Y.,"Falls Church, VA",6/6/2016,4.0,"TOP favorites!Fig and Mascarpone bread (must-have each time we go)Salt Crusted Prime Rib (YUM)Meat Loaf and Gravy (husband's favorite)Diver Scallops with RisottoHam and Peas Mac and CheeseLobster Mac and Cheese (Both mac and cheeses are so good)Goat cheese ravioli with chicken cutletSurprisingly, not a huge fan of the fried green tomatoes. The fried batter came off of each tomato when I bit into it, and it just was okay. However, I love the whole feel of this place. We try to get there early cause it gets packed fast. Be sure to make a reservation or plan to sit at the bar. Their cocktails are awesome. I got a strawberry fizz and it was refreshing, but I think they shine when it comes to their whiskey drinks."

Updated review",5.0,"Just went back to founding farmers, and it is still 5 stars in my book! I had a reservation for two and showed up early and they were able to seat me right away, even on a Friday night. This time I got the Constitution cocktail, which was the perfect balance of sour and sweet. For dinner, I got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crispy and excellent but the star in my book was the side of Mac and cheese- creamy and delicious with homemade pasta! My friend and I split the apple pie for dessert, which was massive but excellent! If you want solidly good, southern inspired food with an upscale atmosphere and great prices, Founding Farmers is your place!"
Nicole R.,"Lincoln, NH",8/20/2017,5.0,"Best food in DC. For sure make a stop here if you are near by... or far... it's definitely worth it!!!! Staff has a positive attitude, always smiling and incredibly nice!"
Victoria H.,"Washington, DC",12/3/2016,4.0,"Very busy for brunch so be sure to make a reservation. Pretty open for afternoon and dinnertimes. The cornbread is so delicious, I order it every time I dine here. Good amount of vegetarian options, but I've had better vegetarian food in Seattle. The scratch sodas are all tasty. A full menu is served at an open-seating bar area so peek around for a seat if the wait times are full. People tend to hawk during brunch for a seat so don't expect a leisurely, long meal if you're sitting in the bar area."
Michaelyn M.,"Washington, DC",7/1/2016,5.0,"Honestly my favorite place to eat in D.C. However, tip to all: (!!!) make reservations before hand, otherwise you will most likely have to wait, no matter what time of day it is. I've never had a problem reserving a table, even the day of. All the food is amazing, fresh, and extremely tasty. Love this place and would recommend to anyone who comes to visit!"
Eunice L.,"Evanston, IL",6/18/2017,3.0,"I honestly don't get the hype. There's always a wait and the area around the host is always crowded and overwhelming. Plus, the food is just okay. I've gotten the chicken and waffles twice and both times the chicken was really dry. Came a third time for drinks and we could only get seated at the bar. Thankfully that wasn't too bad because the bartender was very attentive and sweet. Every time I've gone the place is packed and loud."
Yadira M.,"Washington, DC",6/3/2016,3.0,"The location is great (Penn location) and the inside is relaxed yet just classy enough to not make you feel out of place in a suit. If you're coming for breakfast, you won't be disappointed. There are plenty of old school and adventurous options (including beignets) and even pick me ups with alcohol. Lunch also has some good options, including pretty tasty deviled eggs and deeply satisfying grilled cheese (though dipping into the tomato soup was too salty for my taste)."
Claire N.,"Metuchen, NJ",1/26/2017,5.0,"Quick trip to D.C. - Came to FF on a Tuesday evening (6PM) with three other people. I get it, D.C. is generally busy every day but I was really surprised at how the restaurant was just bustling with hungry guests. It's clearly a trendy hot-spot and the decor matched with its extremely modern touch. We were seated on the upper level which was extremely nice and our service was amazing. I ordered the Chicken Bolognese Bucatini and Skillet Cornbread. Everything was amazing. FYI: The pasta dish is cream based. (I guess that's why it was just so indulgent - Yum). Due to the tastiness of the food, I desperately wanted to scarf it all down but I had to be classy and twirl my bucatini (large spaghetti) with grace. The cornbread was served in a mini cast-iron skillet. It was bigger than we expected and I suggest that you ask them to bring small plates to share with your table. It was crispy and moist in all of the right places. There are actual kernels of corned baked into the cornbread which was awesome.  The honey butter that accompanies it isn't mixed well. They literally pour honey into the cup first and then place butter on top. Not complaining though. I enjoyed it!"
Kristian M.,"Naples, FL",12/17/2015,5.0,"What a cool place! I was in DC for 2 days and on the last day we decided to come here for dinner.Ok let's get to it.We started out with their cornbread accompanied by some honey butter. The cornbread was not dry, like right in the middle of dry corn bread and corn bread soufflé. I LOVED IT! Totally satisfied my sweet and salty flavor preference.I ordered the Yankee pot roast, and oh sweet Jesus! I was in heaven. The meat was so soft and juicy, it just fell apart without me having to make any effort. The mashed potatoes that were hiding underneath were also very good. Overall, this was a great experience and it was probably the highlight of my trip! I can't wait to go back and see what else they have that southern and delicious!5 stars."
Theresa H.,"Houston, TX",6/26/2017,5.0,My friends and I went to Founding Farmers and the food was DELICIOUS. I would highly recommend coming here. It seemed like every single dish ordered by my friends was delicious. I HIGHLY recommend getting the Lobster Mac. It's worth the $30! Also the cornbread is a must buy! I found myself craving their food again by the end of the week!
Carter V.,"Columbia, MO",6/26/2017,5.0,"I don't give 5 stars to anyone, but this place definitely deserved each and every one of them! Visiting from Missouri, we found this place online and decided to make a reservation to give it a whirl. We had a booth in the upstairs area, which was perfect for our group of 5. We had two servers (Faye and Callie) who were AMAZING! They helped us make food decisions (definitely recommend the chicken and waffles or the filet!) and drink decisions (cucumber drink is the way to go!), and were super helpful! Of course we had to stay for dessert, which I highly recommend the carrot cake. Seriously, great service (best service we had in D.C. to date!), great food, and great ambiance. The only thing you will regret is not making a reservation!"
Hannah A.,"Bowie, MD",1/14/2017,5.0,Even though we literally had to stand at the bar for hours someone had to leave for us to sit.. the good was worth the wait. The garlic black pepper chicken was sooooo good! The steak was amazing! Omg I can't wait to go back!
Chris S.,"Palm Springs, CA",12/3/2016,3.0,"My wife and I dined here based in the thousands of reviews !!  We came solely for the prime rib ..  Service was great , the place was packed on a Friday night !!  We didn't have a reservation and the hostess was awesome to get us in !!That being said we were very disappointed with the prime rib ..   Crab cake and corn bread were fantastic, but the prime rib need some work .."
Takera W.,"Washington, DC",12/27/2015,4.0,This place is excellent. It was definitely crowded and we had a bit of a wait but it was worth it. We started out at the bar with a couple drinks. When our table was ready we were seated and our waitress was courteous. I enjoyed a pasta dish. I also ordered a chicken stew to go which was magnificent. I also ordered a fish dish as well. Everything was great. I definitely will be going back.
Jon H.,"Washington, DC",8/8/2017,3.0,"Always popular, always busy so you need reservations.  Nice crafty dishes that are satisfying, I typically go with the fried chicken salad.  It's a convenient spot for lunch and it's consistent."
Rebekah C.,"Roseville, CA",6/4/2017,4.0,I've been here a few times and have really fallen in love with the Southern style. The restaurant has a fun atmosphere and is great place to go after work. The food is delicious and the wait staff is very friendly and fun. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun place to hang out.
Tracey M.,"Jersey City, NJ",8/20/2016,4.0,"They had no reservations available for Sunday morning so they said we could walk in and feel out of there would be a wait or not. When we arrived the hostesses said it'd be 15-20 minutes which worked for us. Two minutes into waiting a hostess comes up and tells us we can be seated but the table is being saved for a reservation in about an hour and a half, so we will have to be out by then. It was a very strange request that while we understand, is usually not communicated with the guest. If you are running behind, it's not the guests' responsibility to be out the door before your reservation comes. You can choose to seat us or not at the risk of your reservations.Other than that, and the fact that the food came before our utensils did, we had a good meal. Both of us went southern style and enjoyed chicken and waffles and steak and eggs and it was top quality food. A place I would probably return to and recommended for others to eat. Service memo above is just something For others to expect or beware or management to improve on! Thank you."
Jerica B.,"Longwood, Bronx, NY",2/20/2017,5.0,"This is the third time that we've been here and it's beyond amazing. The first time we came to D.C. we had a reservation here for dinner but decided to cancel it but were we wrong! The next day we went here for breakfast and the line was out the door so if that didn't speak volume for the place I don't know what would of. Because we didn't have a reservation we waited about 45 minutes. Worth the wait!! Everything here seems wonderful but we had the banana frost pancakes and they are to die for. Every since then we come back to D.C. once a year mainly because of this place. This time we came here for dinner and breakfast. We enjoyed the chicken and waffles, and the goat cheese ravioli with chicken cutlets for dinner. We then had our normal banana frost pancakes and waffles with founding farmers breakfast. If your ever in D.C. this is place is a MUST!!!"
Jeff C.,"Castro Valley, CA",5/27/2016,4.0,"This was on my wife's must eat DC list so we made sure we found some time to get out here.  Dinner reservations were a little hard to snag, so we arranged an early lunch reservation instead.  The concept is pretty cool- farm to table food, with the food sourced from family run farms.  They do it up nice as well, with the restaurant having an upscale, hipster vibe.We had heard the signature dish was the chicken and waffles ($16) so we got that and the creamy vegetable bacon bucatini ($15).  Both dishes were solid, but I did really love the chicken and waffles despite my usual dislike for the sweet/salty mix.  The chicken skin was crispy/crunchy outside and the chicken nice and moist inside, even the white meat.  Bravo!  Definitely recommend that if you visit!"
J G.,"Bethesda, MD",8/7/2017,2.0,"I wish I loved this because it is convenient.  But the food is just not special.  It is crowded and rushed and noisy.  I can't understand why people pick this place when there are so many better places to eat in DC. vI wouldn't have bothered to review this but Yelp asked if I had been here and I have.  I go for business lunches occasionally.  I don't loathe it but I sure don't look forward to it.  I know I will have ""meh"" meal with too much fat and too much salt and not enough taste."
Stella G.,"Arlington, VA",6/25/2017,5.0,The best place for brunch!   We take all our visitors from out of town and they love it!   There is soo much delicious food!  We spend about 2 hours there!
David G.,"Shrewsbury, MA",8/19/2017,1.0,"I was very disappointed.  I ordered a ""Farmers Slaw Reuben Sandwich."" My biggest gripe is that the sandwich contained the word ""Reuben""; it was in no way shape or form a Reuben sandwich.  It wasn't on rye, I detected no Swiss cheese, and I only discovered the single micro-thin slice of corn beef when the sandwich got so soggy it literally fell apart on the plate.  If this was properly called a coleslaw sandwich (which it definitely was), then I wouldn't have ordered it.  Adding a .000001 ounce of corn beef doesn't make a sandwich a Reuben.  Also, the flavor of the coleslaw would have overpowered any other flavors anyway.  The pickled potato salad I obtained  with it was so-so.   I saw some of the desserts going out and they looked good, but decided not to waste any more money on the place."
Lily W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6/22/2016,4.0,"First of all, please make a reservation before you decide to come here. This place is BUSSSSY! Even with a reservation, they won't seat us unless all party have arrived. Me and my girl friend came here for a Saturday brunch, i have heard many good things about this place prior to my reservation. After enjoying a wonderful chicken and waffle meal, I can definitely see what all the hypes about. I also enjoy their mimosa, I just wish they have bottomless mimosa. Haha anyway, if you're debating whether to come or not, give them a shot! :)"
Steve S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2/18/2017,2.0,"We ate at Founding Farmers this weekend when we were in DC.  It was a last minute replacement reservation for a restaurant that had cnacelled our reservation the day before because that restaurant was going to be closed.  We had eaten here on earlier trips to DC and the food was good.  This time, not so much.  We arrived a few minutes late for our reservation but were seated quickly (a good sign).  However when we ordered our drinks (a glass of wine and a cocktail), the wine came rather quickly but the cocktail took about 15 minutes to appear at our table (really?)  The roasted chicken that my dinner companion had was very dry, almost to the point of being inedible.  The shrimp and grits that I had were ok, but I have had much better elsewhere.  Given the dinner experience that we had and the many other options for fine dining in DC I do not think we will be coming back on our next trip to town. If you want a good dinner, I would also suggest that you go somewhere other than Founding Farmers for your meal."
Erin K.,"Haddon Heights, NJ",11/20/2016,5.0,"My husband and I went to Founding Farmers this morning for brunch after checking out of our hotel. Opentable had no reservations until tomorrow, so we took a shot and called, getting a reservation for 2 at 1115. The place was PACKED-and as we later learned from our awesome and friendly bartender-it was not nearly as crowded as it usually is. We got there at 1045 and told them we'd arrived, to which they said we'd be seated first for the 1115 seating. We grabbed a coffee drink at the bar and 2 seats opened up so we cancelled our table and ate there. Everything was awesome! We split the doughnut balls (beignets I think they're called-we're from Jersey and def botched this one lol) and got the traditional eggs Benedict and the crab Benedict with a side of bacon (pictured below). Great people watching, cool modern yet homey ambiance-no wonder it's a hot spot. Though the crowd was large the bartender made time chatting with us and even took care of our drinks as it was my birthday yesterday. Not to mention- we had leftovers and our bill was under $60. We'll definitely recommend Founding Farmers, perfect end to a D.C. weekend.(Don't let the crowd scare you away, if you have a small party the bar had seats opening up in a little more timely fashion. )"
Jody L.,"Philadelphia, PA",5/24/2017,5.0,"The food at founding farmers was fantastic. We started with 3 starters: fried tomatoes, bacon wrapped dates, and corn bread (as recommended by the waiter). All the starters were fantastic, but I would highly recommend the corn bread. It was prepared in a small skillet, enough to feed 5-6 people. For the entree, I order scallops which were incredibly juicy and grilled to perfection. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Be sure to have a reservation, even on a weeknight. We went on a Wednesday night around 7 and still had to wait despite having a reservation."
Cat T.,"Oakland, CA",5/31/2016,4.0,"The food was great at Founding Farmers, while visiting DC I wanted to dine at the happening places with good ratings, this one was one of them downtown, it was super crowded on a Thursday eve, the bar didn't have any room either, I had a reservation so that was not a problem but I read about their cocktails and we arrived early to enjoy a drink at the bar, that didn't happen, I had to go look for a menu, while there were 3 or 4 ladies at the hostess location and were not too accommodating , no big deal.  The plastic sleeve on the menu should go, not for those prices, presentation is key and plastic sleeves are for fast food or Denny's. Tip: Try the mussels! Are excellent!"
Kisadida D.,"Sunset Park, Brooklyn, NY",3/11/2017,5.0,"Sorry this is a review late for one year:)My husband and I took both our parents to travel in DC last June and had brunch at this gem spot. I heard it's hard to make reservation but we were lucky to get a around 11am table. The decor is very classic and the menu is a little complex because we have to understand how to choose the side for different dish. You can choose your own combination of brunch sides and every dish we ordered were fantastic. I'm New Yorker but I hadn't have such great brunch in NYC. I'm serious! The beignets is amazing, vary warm and soft. The three different flavor jam to dip the beignets were also mind blowing. The banana toast was also good!In Main entry, I remember we ordered beef pastrami which was wonderful, and scramble which was terrific!I would go to D.C. Just for dining one more time at this place^^How unbelievable that I still remember the feeling at this spot one year ago!"
Jessica G.,"Falls Church, VA",6/13/2017,5.0,"I love this place! Decent prices, locally sourced food, and good service. Make sure to make reservations, though! It gets busy after 5:30pm."
Tim K.,"Boston, MA",11/17/2016,4.0,"My wife and I came to DC for our honeymoon and were really looking forward to breakfast here. We wanted a more private time and made a reservation weeks in advance. When we were seated 4 inches from another table, we asked for a different one, of which there were three open. The hostess, in a extremely condescending tone, told us they were for larger parties only. Mind you a party of two who got to the restaurant at the same time as us got one of the larger tables without issue. We pointed this out to no avail. We finally decided to sit at the bar instead. After that, everything was great. The food, the drinks, the bartender - all were excellent. So all in all a good time once seated. And no, no one ever sat at the three empty tables the entire time we were there."
Beatrice G.,"Huntingtown, MD",2/13/2017,4.0,"The cornbread is AMAZING. Seriously, I have to order every time I come.This place stays crowded! I've walked past as soon as they've opened on a weekday and there was a line. Every time I've visited, I've had to wait in the small waiting area (or outside). They will not seat you until your entire party has arrived, so be sure to tell your guests to arrive on time, or earlier so you can divulge in the cornbread sooner! Ha!There are two tiers, the upstairs is a bit fancier than the downstairs. If you plan on going on a date, be sure to ask for upstairs seating to make it more intimate.I brought my infant son on my first visit, but realized we were out of place. I would not want to bring him again, though it's a bit noisy throughout the venue.I had a few drinks here, and they were okay. I like to get a little buzz going whenever I do have the opportunity to drink (still making up for the nine months I couldn't drink four years ago lol). But in all seriousness, their mimosas had me loopy. The cornbread is phenomenal. The pot roast leaves your mouth watering! The chicken and waffle is okay.There is street parking that can be tricky if you aren't careful to look at the signs (and understand them). I did get a parking ticket on my first visit, so please know the area is monitored."
Jonathan H.,"Quincy, MA",3/28/2017,3.0,"Came with a group of 3 others for dinner. It was a good experience, the staff was friendly, and we enjoyed the food for the most part. You will need a reservation or you'll have to wait 1+ hours during peak/normal meal times.The chicken for the chicken & waffles was dry - this contrasted with the garlic/pepper wings. I got the ribeye steak. It was prepared alright. The fat was not at a melted-like stage and the garlic/salt rub was applied inconsistently. Still, given the price, the steak was pretty good and I wasn't expecting steakhouse quality on all levels. The drinks were fine too, but nothing notable."
Mark S.,"Washington, DC",1/12/2017,2.0,"Every time I try again, disappointed. Decidedly average food prices as though it is something special. In any other location this would have gone out of business years ago. Could not survive 6 months on 14th street or Georgetown. The refusal to seat 3 in a table of 4 in an empty restaurant is the height of arrogance and stupidity. Rather than seat us and get a drink order and an app they lose a customer. With my proximity and how often we eat out, it is just bad business. If you have to eat and are stuck at this corner, you likely will not get salmonella. But if you have the ability, go elsewhere. Baja Fresh is a block away. You can get the same quality for a fraction of the cost."
Cee M.,"Waldorf, MD",12/17/2015,5.0,"This place is fantastic! The customer service, the food, and dining environment is everything I hoped it to be. I came to FF for my friend's birthday. I made a reservation one week out. As soon as we arrived, we were seated in about 5 mins or less. Our waiter Richard was EXTREMELY busy but he still managed to provide awesome service. We had the lobster Mac and cheese and the braised short ribs! All I can say is deeeeeeelish!Afterwards Richard brought over a hot basket of beignets! (Ugh I just went to food heaven thinking about it) He even put a candle in the beignets! With drinks, our bill was about $90. I would definitely return to this place. I WILL return!"
Benjamin B.,"Washington, DC",4/24/2017,5.0,I love this place and its connections to farmers around the U.S. -- including a co-op that my father-in-law works for in North Dakota! The food is excellent as is the ambiance and service. A must try in in DC!
Geoffrey B.,"San Antonio, TX",3/27/2017,2.0,"Definitely overhyped.  It's breakfast yo?  Ordered the farmer's breakfast - eggs and potatoes with toast, chicken apple sausage and bacon.  The maple pepper bacon is 5 star, skip the chicken sausage.  Eggs are good but nothing special.  Loved my toast.  Beignets are made too big so they are undercooked, and are powdered when they are too hot, so the sugar melts into a glaze of fat and sugar vs. powdering.   The sauces should be unnecessary.Friend ordered a scramble - which was loaded with ninja onions - not listed on the menu.   Service was ok but nothing special.   Location in an office building seemed like an elevated Denny's.  Seriously, it's elevated - on the second floor.  Was it bad?  No.  Would I wait 2 hours like the people without a reservation?  Heck to the no.   Make your reservations in advance."
Rachna B.,"Rochester, NY",6/5/2016,5.0,"This place is awesome! My party and I didn't make a reservation so our wait time was about 45 minutes- an hour but with luck we only ended up waiting maybe 25 minutes before being seated. Service here is quick and efficient! The restaurant is known for their very popular chicken and waffles, something almost everyone at my table got! It was delicious. Instead I decided to get their regular farmers breakfast. It came with two perfectly poached eggs, ciabatta bread (delicious with their homemade jam), hash browns made with leeks (definitely order this, even if it's not part of your meal! They are delicious!!) and bacon. I chose to upgrade my bacon to a hot sauce glaze as per the recommendation of our lovely waitress Bernadette. It was probably some of the best thick sliced bacon I've ever had! If you can handle hot sauce it's definitely worth trying.  For drinks I got a Peach Bellini, it wasn't anything too special, but it was really tasty! Overall, this place was great! Definitely worth a try for some great brunch!"
E G.,"Bar Harbor, ME",1/23/2017,4.0,"Service makes or breaks an experience. I dined between lunch and dinner, so through shift change. Had two different servers. First was Ashley: warm, friendly, helpful. Replaced by Jorge: arupt, distant and cold. It is indicative of how great a job Ashley did. The stark contrast between the two made my experience wonderful at the beginning and a bit dismal by the end.The food was nice. I enjoyed their butternut squash soup and chicken bolognese bucatini and a slice of toasted, buttered bread. The cocktails are potent. Although I did order strong ones: vesper and martinez.The hostess was friendly and accomodating. I had made a 3:45 reservation and arrived a full half hour early. She was able to seat me within 10 minutes or so.Tip: Be sure you have your full party there before asking to be seated. They do not seat incomplete parties. This policy is on their website as well. Overall a pleasant experience, minus one bump in the road."
Steph S.,"Newbury Park, CA",6/13/2016,5.0,"I was here for a conference and decided to give this place a try. Although, I was. Bit skeptical with all the great reviews but It's as  good as all the reviews say it is! Such a modern, aesthetically pleasing place to eat, clean restrooms, delicious breakfast and I don't normally drink coffee ever, but had it here and it was delicious."
Tristan D.,"Craig, AK",6/10/2017,4.0,I got the Farmhouse Platter; the mini burgers were amazing! Definitely try the cornbread. It's the best in the District.
Jake R.,"Uptown, Houston, TX",5/29/2017,5.0,"Although it is constantly overrun by hippies, this place is the best restaurant that I've ever eaten at in my life. I have been here about a dozen times and never gotten the same thing. Everything I've eaten has been incredible. Get a reservation before you show up"
Dena R.,"Allen, TX",10/21/2015,2.0,"Of course being a Yelper, I scoured restaurant reviews before our recent trip to Washington D.C. and decided Founding Farmers was one we needed to try.  I made reservations in advance and we were seated shortly after our arrival in the upstairs dining room.  The decor has a hipster-modern vibe, matching what one might expect from a farm-to-table establishment.  We were greeted by the manager at our table, who explained the restaurant's concept and offered any assistance we might need.  We were next greeted by our server.I wanted a drink with tequila but did not like the spicy or grapefruit options on the menu.  Our server offered that they could hand make anything I liked and I ordered a margarita.  My bf is a die-hard Dr. Pepper drinker, but they did not have typical soft drinks here.  He settled for a sweet tea.  My margarita was strong but tasty, albeit somewhat small.  Tea was average.We started with the skillet corn bread with sea salted honey butter to share.  The corn bread was good, not great.  I did like the whole kernels of corn baked inside.  The honey butter was odd, it was a scoop of butter sitting on top of honey, not mixed together.  I didn't taste anything ""sea salted"" about it.I decided to splurge for the lobster mac & cheese ($28) and he ordered the prime rib dip.  I forgot to order a side of fried green tomatoes, but flagged our server down to ask if it was too late to add to our order.  He accommodated us easily and our food all arrived simultaneously.Fried green tomatoes - good, but again not great.  The ones I make at home are tastier than these. They were definitely lacking seasoning, not salted at all.  The two sauces that came with, a garlic sauce and a green tomatillo type sauce, were delicious, even if they didn't really seem to go with the green tomatoes.Lobster mac & cheese - SUPER dry and lacking any sort of flavor.  A huge disappointment for the price point.  I wouldn't order it again for free.Prime rib dip - I didn't try it, but my boyfriend did not enjoy it.  The meat was lacking flavor and the au jus was thick and greasy. After our meals were delivered, our server disappeared.  We did not see him (and we could see the entire upstairs dining area from our table) for at least 15 to 20 minutes.  We were out of drinks and had food issues.  No other server came nearby enough to ask for help either.  At that point, my bf got up and found the manager.  We explained what happened with our server and also that he wasn't happy with his food.  I asked for some extra sauce for my mac & cheese to try to salvage it.  The manager did not look happy about the situation and went off to make things right.  He said he would return to ensure we were happy.I was brought a huge bowl sized portion of cheesy sauce.  I wasn't sure if this was a ""here's your $*&#^$* sauce"" move, or just what they had to serve the sauce in.  It didn't really help the dryness of the lobster mac & cheese, which by that time looked like a gelatinous pile of paste.  Our original server came back by, which was super awkward, because it was clear he had been reprimanded.  He informed us our entire check had been taken care of, which I was not expecting.  It was a nice gesture, but I did not expect them to take care of anything except for the sandwich which we sent back.  The manager never came back by to check on us again, but maybe we left before he could.  I ended up cancelling our reservation at their sister restaurant because of this experience.  I was so excited to try this place and so disappointed with almost every aspect of our dinner."
Josette S.,"Miami, FL",4/26/2016,5.0,"All I can say is if you're in DC you have to go to Founding Farmers. This farm to table restaurant is amazing! From the snazzy decor, the amazing menu options, you really are in for a treat. I will say calling to make a reservation is advised. The place gets packed, to the point where we decided to wait to just sit at the bar. The bartender was beyond attentive and also rather patient with us, seeing we couldn't figure out what we wanted at first. To start off we ordered the corn bread, which was heavenly! It was fresh and you have full kernels of corn inside. You didn't even need to put butter on it. It was perfect as is. We also ordered the Brie bread, which was in their fresh bread layered with Brie (of course), thinly sliced apples, and this onion jam that added such a perfect balance to each bite. Now the main course, I would have gone for a heavy duty, don't mess with me I'm stuffing my face kind of meal, but since I wasn't feeling so hot that evening I decided to go for a soup and salad. The soup of the day was a chicken noodle soup, which ordinarily sound boring and unless you sick in bed I don't usually ordered. Well son of a nutcracker, man was I surprised at how yummy it was. They could have brought out a bucket of the soup and I would have just dunked my head right in. The flavor and seasoning was on point and the chicken was perfection. They gave hearty chunks of chicken. It's served with their bread which I recommend letting it soak up some of the broth. For the salad, I picked the tuna poke. The salad is big enough to share. The tuna was so fresh it almost melted in my mouth and the dressing wasn't over powering where it took away from the tuna flavor and it also had a nice kick to it. I also tasted the rotisserie chicken and the pot roast that my best friend and my cousin ordered. Those are also two dishes I would highly recommend. Oh and by the way I'm convinced the food is prepared by magical elves or something, because the food came out so fast, it was impressive. Now I do have one teeny tiny negative moment that I have to express. When we walked in, there were two girls behind the hostess booth. The blonde hostess wouldn't even acknowledge us. Thank goodness the other young lady was there to be welcoming and accommodating. Both times we went up she assisted us while the blonde girl looked up, made eye contact with me, gave me a cold look and then looked back down as if I wasn't even there. So to the other young lady, many thanks for your warm and welcoming treatment.Other than that, I can't wait to go back!"
Chris N.,"Atlanta, GA",5/15/2016,5.0,"Here is what we had in our party:Seafood Bucatini - Super Highly Recommend!Cedar planked salmon with maple sweet potato and autumn succotash - highly fragrant.Arctic charChicken Pot PieProsciutto Farm BreadSkillet Corn BreadFarm SaladManhattan Soda - Coffee Soda, weird, but excellently executed concept.  Makes me wonder why there is no coffee soda in the markets yet.Scratch Soda - Ginger - you can taste the gingerI would go back here just for the seafood bucatini and Manhattan soda alone.  Great ambience and excellent food.  Be sure to make a reservation in advance or risk an 1-3 hour wait."
Nancy A.,"Gurnee, IL",7/20/2016,4.0,We booked 3 weeks in advance because we know how crazy busy this place can get. We were seated right on time. Our server was great but we had issues with the bar not having 2 of the beers we ordered and then having to change the keg. We pretty much should have just skipped the beer entirely. Slow slow slow bar service and annoying that we had to change what we were ordering.  Th chicken and waffles were fantastic. Was pleasantly surprised over the pastrami hash. Will go back again and again.  Love this place.
Josh B.,"Jersey City, NJ",4/26/2016,3.0,"I wouldn't tell you to avoid Founding Farmers even though my own experience wasn't so great. In theory, the crab Benedict could give someone a five-star impression, with its harmonious interaction of crab, egg and seasoning. So I'll leave that review to be written by someone who didn't get a weird ""solo diner"" vibe, whose water didn't have an odd aftertaste and who doesn't care that the leek hash browns taste exactly like regular hash browns."
Don S.,"Washington, DC",6/9/2017,2.0,"In a sense, this is an ""upated"" review. I first dined here way back when it first opened, in 2008. That was a great experience.I have been here two additional times over the years since - and WOW - this place has slipped. I understand why it is starting to get ""Guy Fieri-esq"" reviews in the local papers. Gone is the thought. Gone is the execution. And yet, there are still ridiculous wait times.Even dishes that I always loved are no longer great - as in, ""I'm not going to finish this"" no longer great. I truly wonder what is happening here.Go elsewhere, you hungered, and often touristy masses!"
Joanna S.,"Western Addition, San Francisco, CA",6/11/2016,5.0,"Founding Farmers is a must-try in DC! I had the Yankee pot roast, which was a solid, hearty dish. It had a gigantic portion of pot roast atop a bed of mashed potatoes with a healthy portion of veggies. I also had a taste of the shrimp and grits, which was a cacophony of delicious flavor; the andouille sausage gives it a kick. The cocktails looked amazing, and will definitely come again to try them next time."
Heui Chan L.,"Philadelphia, PA",5/28/2017,4.0,"we got a bloody mary, corn bread, fish and chips, chicken and waffles, prime rib dip and farmer's platter. the corn bread is excellent, especially with bloody mary (ask for basil if you like it in the drink). everything was very good and they give you a ton of food. if you're visiting dc, it's highly recommended. make sure to make a reservation. they are busy all day."
Katy B.,"Rockville, MD",5/28/2017,5.0,"So good! It was packed for a Sunday brunch...make reservations or expect to wait a while - totally worth it! The beignets are amazing, mimosas wonderful and the food is sooo good! I had the veggie scramble and it won't disappoint, check them out!!"

Updated review",3.0,This is our third time at this restaurant. The first two times were wonderful and that's why we decided to return. This third time was not the charm. It was 8 o'clock and after museum hopping all day I so look forward to their delicious prime rib. That was the reason for making the reservation. I was told they had just run out. What???Through disappointment I ordered the 1/2 chicken. I was with two other people and all our meals came and the chicken was so dry it was not edible. I sent it back and I then ordered the spareribs. The spareribs came after the two other people finished their dinner so the spareribs became takeout and I never ate dinner. They did take the spareribs off the bill but I don't understand how the resturant can run out of prime rib when it's a very very popular dish at 8:30 on a Sunday night.
Jenni B.,"Washington, DC",11/27/2016,3.0,"Everyone raves about this place, but honestly I don't get it. It's good. It really is. But I think the hype is way over done. Also the service is seriously slow. Don't go starving because I promise you will be hangry by the time you are even getting drink orders in.In my few visits I've enjoyed some tasty burgers, enchiladas, flat breads and cocktails. Everything has been enjoyable, nothing has blown my mind. I recently visited with my parents because they thought this was on the show Bones or something and I had a mushroom Reuben and a sweet potato with pecans. It was a good sandwich but I hesitate to say it was delicious.The cocktails I really enjoy though and make this place a viable happy hour spot. I love that they have so many options with Rye and concoctions with egg whites. Not necessarily together, but I'd try anything once! I feel like I could easily make my way through their house specials list and never get bored. It would be a good place for a group because there is so much variety. With my parents I was able to get something boozy and dark, my mom ordered something fruity and bright and my dad wanted a local lager on tap. Everybody wins."
Laura W.,"Cedar Park, TX",3/1/2017,4.0,"Absolutely delicious and delightful experience.I recently moved to D.C. and this was pretty high on my list of places to try. Went for weekend brunch and, even with reservations, we had about a 10 minute wait to be seated. Slightly annoying, especially since the front area was extremely crowded, but they were obviously busy. We had two breakfast plates and split the lobster mac and cheese, not the healthiest idea in retrospect but it was so worth it. I only wish we could have finished everything. I will definitely be purchasing their cookbook to try and recreate their dishes at home."
Helen T.,"Richmond, VA",5/12/2016,2.0,"The service here wasn't too great. My boyfriend and I dropped in for lunch, we were immediately seated without a reservation, which was very nice considering they were pretty busy with the lunch rush. We were seated at a shared long table resembling a picnic table in the middle of the restaurants. My boyfriend definitely didn't like that as the stools we sat on were both tall, uncomfortable and not to mention often bumped into due to being located in the middle of the restaurant (high traffic area). I ordered the chicken pot pie and he ordered the roast turkey sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. Presentation was great, we both really liked his Mac and cheese (I snuck in a couple of bites!) and agreed that my chicken pot pie, with the biscuit in the center rather than in a traditional pie format was very tasty, albeit somewhat cold when served. The food overall left something to be desired. Our wait staff seemed impatient with us. When my friend inquired about the drinks our waitress informed us that ""they didn't sell sodas here"" rather only in house made sodas in an extremely rude manner. Okay, that's fine, I understand you must be busy with all these tables and the lunch rush but the snappy attitude was ridiculous. She seemed to realize how off putting it was because she was agreeable the rest of the meal. However we noticed that she wasn't very diligent in coming over to ask if we needed refills or if we needed anything. Not very good wait staff.Decor was nice overall, the bar area seemed nice, we probably won't be returning though."
Fiorella M.,"Miami, FL",5/27/2016,5.0,"Literally the best restaurant I've been to in America. GREAT food, GREAT service, and my favorite part was the prices!!! I honestly felt like I paid way less for the service and yumminess I got to experience. Nathan was our server and he gave great recommendations."
Josh N.,"San Dimas, CA",2/4/2017,5.0,"There's a reason this place has over 8k reviews. First off the bartender Tommy was very helpful in suggesting things on the menu. I ended up with the Pork chop, maple Brussel sprouts, and sweet potato.Our time here was not perfect however a sandwich we ordered came with onions that we did not want and we also ordered an appetizer that never came.  All of this is forgiven when I tasted the food. This is mind blowing searched your whole life to taste kind of food. I don't live here but would travel here just to have the meal I just ate."
Felicia W.,"Manhattan, NY",11/17/2016,5.0,"One of the best restaurants in DC. make sure you get the cornbread if you go, it is so good and I am still craving it. Another popular appetizer is the kettle corn. They have a variety of cocktails (I got the constitution). GO. you won't regret it."
Geo G.,"Washington, DC",6/20/2017,5.0,"If you want a table, make a reservation.  But we have always been able to sit at the bar. Been there now several times, my new favorite place .Great appetizers,are the dumplings"
Martha W.,"Washington, DC",10/23/2016,3.0,"3.5 stars. I should have ordered the eggs instead of the stuffed French toast. Simply too sweet. I was there with a group of seven and everyone was basically pleased with the food (eggs, waffles, coffee, juice) and service. I felt a little too old for the young crowd. Great people-watching. Very lively atmosphere. Will go back when my friends have college-aged young-ins with them!"

Updated review",5.0,"I was at Founding Farmers 2 years ago and I said I would try them again.  Every time I see grits on an entrée, I frown up.  I do like grits but I just cant see eating them for lunch or dinner.  Ok, with that being said, the shrimp, grits, and sausage is a must!!!!!!..  If they could ship that to me in Florida I would buy it..  I was blown away by the flavor.  Hats off to the chefs that made this happen.  The food was hot and fresh.  Next time I'm in DC, the grits is definitely on my list!!!!!!!!!"
Tara B.,"North Charleston, SC",5/16/2017,5.0,"We enjoyed our brunch here while visiting Washington DC. Two things I would like to point out: 1.) reservations HIGHLY recommended and 2.) if you want a mimosa or Bloody Mary with your brunch, make that reservation after 10am.  We knew about the reservation needed due to friends who had been there. We were very happy to have made it since the place was very busy. However, we had made our reservation for 9am. I wish the website had mentioned no alcohol before 10am, and we would have made our reservation for later. The hostess told us we could ""go over to the bar and enjoy some orange juice if we liked.""  I thought that was ""orange juice--wink, wink"" code for mimosas. Lol. So we ordered 2 mimosas and the bar tender looked at us like we each had 2 heads and replied ""we can't serve alcohol until after 10:00am.""  Ok then. I had no clue since I come from a city where the night shift nurses go out for mimosas after work at 7:30am on Sunday mornings. So anyway, the food was great. I loved my chicken and waffles that I had. We also had fantastic service. Location is nice too. We walked to the White House from there after we ate."

Updated review",1.0,"Was 3 Stars, the last time I was here, this place has gone downhill, the hostesses at the front waiting area are over worked and have a very poor attitude.  I was quoted 30 mins wait time, the wait ended up being over 1.5 hrs.  If you need to come here, plan on waiting for a very long time.We kept getting ""come back in 20 mins"" excuses, well that 20 mins became 1 1/2 hours, and on top of that, we had to share the table with another group.To add more insult to injury, the silverware was dirty, food was stuck on the fork still..."
Heidi H.,"San Jose, CA",6/3/2016,3.0,"I had the shrimp bucatini and it was good. Their homemade pasta was done right, the sauce was tasty not heavy and shrimp was cooked perfectly.. We also had the deviled eggs and those were ok a lil on the salty side. My husband had the hot dog trio and said it was good. Overall this restaurant is ok."
Hanisha A.,"Inglewood, CA",12/29/2016,5.0,"I let me server choose my dinner and it was the best decision. Started with blue cheese stuffed bacon wrapped dates that were like grown folk candy in my mouth, sweet and savory. Woke my tastes buds up and readied me for pot roast...tender beef and fresh vegetables on top of mashed potatoes! Slap yo mama! Washed it down with a spicy and delicious Clemetime cocktail (I wanted to lick all the sugar off the glass). Like all the other reviews...fantastic food and great service. Reservations are a MUST unless you don't mind an hour wait."
DJ M.,"Williamsburg, VA",8/18/2017,4.0,"What a great restaurant, the whirly pop- corn was fantastic, finely done steaks, perfect prime rib and a large selection of libations."
S S.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/5/2017,4.0,Nice place. Nice server  I am giving 4stars to the meal because there was only half an strawberry in my fruit cup! The sauce on egg benedict was not enough and the meal was not warm.
Ellen S.,"Bowie, MD",5/14/2017,4.0,Came here for brunch! We each ordered something different and everything was superb. Highly recommend coming on the weekend!
Lily C.,"Islip, NY",12/12/2016,4.0,"The beignets were divine. We got there around 9 and it was already packed. A good sign. You don't get over 8K 4 star + reviews on Yelp! and expect differently. But the reason why it got all those great reviews is because the food was excellent. My eggs were cooked perfectly. I'm really fussy about my eggs too. I like them medium well. I also had the carrot cake pancakes. They were very very good, not the best I've had but a close second. The highlight was definitely the beignets though and out waiter. I wish I remembered his name for this review. He was from California. That much I remembered. Anyway, he was great. Funny and really great even though it was crazy crowded. It was a Sunday. Anyway, I would absolutely go back again."
Debbie B.,"Brandon, FL",6/4/2017,4.0,There was a very long line as would be expected on a Sunday morning but we were able to jump in a bar seat pretty quickly. The strawberry cream French toast was amazing. The service was also super!
Yvan G.,"Ortonville, MI",1/27/2017,5.0,"Had probably the best prime rib of my life! It was a sea salt encrusted prime rib with a side of maple pecan encrusted sweet potato and succotash. For starters we had one of their sweet breads topped with prosciutto, fig, olives and balsamic. That was a very tasty combo. Had a five star saison ale that just topped off the entire meal. It was delicious, quick, and quite enjoyable!"
Laine C.,"Washington, DC",8/7/2017,4.0,"This place is super popular and has a great brunch vibe. We were seated upstairs which I felt had a significantly better ambiance than downstairs which was incredibly noisy. We enjoyed the crab corn dip as well as the fried green tomatoes. The steak and (3) eggs were pretty good, too! Portions were on the larger side, which was nice given that's not usually been my experience in the DC brunch scene.  Service was excellent and I'd definitely come back!"
Tony M.,"Washington, DC",3/19/2017,3.0,"Located in the IMF HQ #2 Building, they do a very busy Business lunch business, so busy that if you're late 15 minutes past your reservation, it is cancelled or revert to ""walk in"" status which is about 30-45 minutes.They boast ""farmer"" ingredients, and quite frankly, the menu was not memorable that I could recite much from it.  Thus, it is the ""wholesomeness"" of ingredients rather than the dishes,For that wholesomeness, it is expensive."
David T.,"Palm Bay, FL",11/3/2016,4.0,"The washington post gave this place zero stars, so I had to try it out. I came in for a late lunch on a Tuesday.I was seated promptly, the service was good, the food was good and the place was clean. Simple as that. The prices are not great - $16 for meatloaf with potatoes and green beans BUT GUESS WHAT? Any place a 15 minute walk from the White House isn't going to be on the cheap side. I would go back. I wouldn't wait 3 hours for a table but it's a nice place to have a meal."
Christine L.,"Ann Arbor, MI",6/3/2017,5.0,I can understand the popularity of this restaurant. The host was really friendly and the staff were nice and made sure if food was good.

Mekdela T.,"Washington, DC",5/29/2016,3.0,"I've been dying to try founding farmers and finally got a reservation for lunch time on a Saturday. Although I wanted brunch, I figured lunch would do because the chicken and waffles is what everyone talks about and it's on the lunch menu. The restaurant is large, and we were sat 10 minutes before our reservation time. The service was great, I enjoyed our server. For the appetizer, we ordered the cornbread....AMAZING. If I come back, it's to try brunch, and get the cornbread again! The skillet cornbread was 5 dollars and I loved it! The sea salt honey butter sounded scary at first, but went so well with the cornbread, GET IT.For lunch, I got the chicken and waffles with Mac and cheese and red potatoes. Honestly, the food was pretty average. I wish my chicken could have been seasoned a little more, and the waffles looked thick, but were actually really thin. I'd rather have fluffy waffles. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits. Before we ordered, the server was nice enough to let us know that the shrimp and grits are more soupy than what we would expect. We ordered the dish anyways, keep in mind, if you want extra grits...6 dollars. The shrimp and grits were actually pretty tasty, we enjoyed the dish. Overall, food was average, service was great. I'll be back for brunch!"
Rob W.,"New York, NY",11/8/2016,5.0,So many choices of delicious food. Casual but upscale enough to wear a suit or tennis shoes. Make a reservation if party of more than four. I was a walkin with two others in a very busy night at 6pm. 15 minute wait time. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.

Stephanie R.,"Redmond, WA",6/16/2017,5.0,"Just ate brunch there. So good! They were right on time (we were seated at 2pm, our reservation was at 2pm). Despite how busy they were, we felt like we were eating at a very small personal restaurant. I highly recommend the cornbread skillet. Also one of the best bloody Mary's I've had, and I consider myself a bit of a Bloody Mary connoisseur. Very friendly waitstaff. Everything cooked and made onsite, and you can taste the freshness. Will definitely go back."
Khushbu M.,"Tampa, FL",1/22/2017,5.0,"Oh my lord, don't even get me started. I started craving some more pasta as I was walking out the door. I got the butternut squash ravioli, and the cranberry burger. DELICIOUS. Seriously some of the most fresh and best tasting food I've ever had. Service was great, and the food was insanely fresh. Also, their freshly made sodas are amazing! We got the ginger soda and the hard orange. The service was also wonderful. The 5 warm cookie desert topped everything off even more :) Definitely on the pricey end, but well worth the splurge."

Leslie T.,"Washington, DC",5/26/2016,5.0,"Honest, genuine, and delicious are what comes to mind when I think about FF.   It's difficult for a restaurant this popular and that can hold this many people to consistently be spot on, but somehow, they manage.  I've been here twice.  The first was for brunch.  We came with a large group of millennials (surprise, surprise) and all of us were in breakfast food heaven.  The stuffed french toast was incredible.  Definitely get that.  The second time, we brought my dad, who was visiting from out of town.  We started with the kettle-corn and it was amazing!  Hot, huge kernels, not too sweet, just right for munching before dinner.  Then we had the goat cheese ravioli (my husband loved the thin pasta casing innovation and the sweet potato sauce), the mushroom sausage gnocchi (I think this was the group favorite-savory, lots of warm spices, evenly balanced sauce.  Get this, you won't regret it!) and the chicken and waffles (fried without being greasy, delicious mac & cheese side).I love that its farm to table without braking the bank.  It's very reasonably priced and they treat everyone like friends.  Come here with high expectations...they will be met!"
Anteese M.,"Capitol Heights, MD",11/10/2016,5.0,"This was my first time here and start to finish the experience was exceptional! It wasn't crowded, we were seated right away. We had a huge stroller with us and they accommodated perfectly! My hubby had the chicken pot pie he LOVED IT! I had the chicken bolognese it was good a little oily, but that honestly didn't bother me. Oh! How can I forget the black pepper garlic wings SINFUL! John wasn't supposed to be our original server, but I am sure glad he was! He was completely attentive the whole time... his service was phenomenal... our bill was $68 I tipped him $25 he even came back and was like did you mean to tip me that much on purpose and I was like yeah! Your service was damn near immaculate! I truly enjoyed myself!! I will DEFINITELY be back!"

The walk led me past buildings and neighborhoods, most tourists don't traipse though, past the Federal Building, the IMF and a portion of George Washington University.The food and drink were on point. I had the breakfast Chicken & Waffles which came with scrambled eggs, white sauce & syrup. My cappuccino was excellent. I look forward to sampling more of the menu next time in DC. The restaurant seemed to be filled with regulars and for good reason. I recommend making reservations as it appeared difficult to accommodate me and I was a small party of 1!"
Michelle A.,"Queens, NY",11/24/2015,5.0,"I really enjoyed this place. I came here with my family while visiting D.C. for the weekend. We couldn't fit it in for dinner, so had to settle for breakfast even though we aren't breakfast people. We arrived shortly after they opened on a Sunday. I made reservations, but it wasn't necessary since it was pretty empty. It's not a large restaurant, so I can see it getting packed during busy times. Our server was really sweet and patient. We couldn't decide what to have, so she gave us time. We ended up getting the chicken and waffles, strawberries and cream French toast, beef pastrami hash and blueberry butter pancakes. We told our waitress we heard great things about the fried green tomatoes (which normally aren't served at breakfast). She asked the chef if it were ok to make them for us and they did! Everything was delicious, but the stars were the chicken and waffles and the fried green tomatoes. The chicken and waffles were different because they were served with gravy. It made the dish savory, yet not heavy. The fried green tomatoes were perfectly crisp and not greasy. Thanks Yelpers for the heads up! I want to come back to try their dinner items."
Amy L.,"Pawtucket, RI",12/5/2016,2.0,"I'm hoping I just came on a bad day. I went this morning for breakfast and bellied up to the bar since I was flying solo. The bartender was initially attentive and put my order in quickly. My food came out at the speed of light. I ordered the veggie scrambler which was mediocre. I primarily eat a plant based diet so was pumped to see that as an option, without having to make my own veggie delight! The mix of veggies was just weird. Somewhere along the way I got one random bite of cilantro. The veggies were all cooked to varying done-ness. When I asked for orange juice, I was told they were out of it. Who runs out of oj on a Monday morning?!Someone from the kitchen served me my plate. The presentation was lack luster; a mush of egg whites and veggies smooshed on a plate. My bartender never asked how my meal was or if I needed anything...which I did. I needed salt and ketchup. I also grabbed myself a pitcher of water since there were no refills in sight. While eating, there was some sort of restaurant drama with a begrudging customer and that interfered with the rest of the dining experience. Whatever had happened seemed to have thrown the staff off. Hats off to the bartender for providing me with a glass of oj on the house when the oj fairy arrived at the restaurant."
Ashley W.,"Washington, DC",7/22/2017,1.0,"Please don't go here. Service was slow, waitress only showed up to take the order and drop off the check.  The place was also a bit louder than comfortable for conversation. My wife had prime rib which was salty and overpriced. I ordered the chicken pot pie which should have been advertised as chicken soup covered with a pie crust. It was also extremely salty.  Overall for the two entrees we ordered we paid close to $50, but would have been better off getting prime rib and a Sara Lee frozen pot pie from Harris Teeter."
Jenny R.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",6/14/2017,5.0,My daughters have food allergies and our waitress and the chef worked together to cook them a meal that they both loved. I am extremely thankful that they were so attentive and accommodating. I highly recommend this delicious restaurant.
Sarah H.,"Cambridge, MA",5/4/2017,2.0,"I keep coming here because the chicken and waffles they serve at brunch are spectacular, but the service is bad and seems to be getting worse.Over the years, I have spent hours of my life waiting to be seated here; usually you have to wait at least 10-15 minutes, even when you have a reservation. If you arrive a couple of minutes late, they will have already given your table away. If your party is waiting on one person, they refuse to seat you even when there are literally dozens of empty tables."
Kelsey W.,"Sugar Land, TX",5/31/2017,3.0,"Yummy food - we visited while we were in DC for a weekend getaway. The food is good, but pricey. And the atmosphere was a bit more crowded and loud than I expected for the price. They tables are really close together so it felt like we were having dinner with the neighboring table..."
Sabrina F.,"Orlando, FL",12/31/2016,3.0,"Service was five stars on a busy Friday night.-made a reservation for one for 8:15 pm, but got there fifteen minutes late. By that time the wait line was almost busting out the door. I was almost about to wait too, but the lovely hostesses pulled some strings and I was able to be seated right away. Thanks girls! -got a waiter who was nice and really good. No complaints at all with his service.Food was two stars unfortunately-drink was ok, strong (something with absinthe in it), couldn't finish it but that's ok.-Seafood devilish eggs were ok, kinda dry and not much filling. Had better and could make better.-cornbread was really good, glad I tried it.-entree was rib eye with green beans and macaroni and cheese substituted in. The rib eye was well passed well done when I requested medium. EPIC FAIL. The mac and cheese was ok, no complaints. The green beans didn't taste like it had lemon in it at all, but I was ok. Kinda disappointed because that's the only reason I ordered it.I was totally expecting more from this place, but I think that's kinda the issue you run into going to a place as popular and crowded as this place. They're trying to rush us in and out like cattle with a mediocre experience. I believe if I came on a slower night the food and service would both be good."
Cady H.,"Mays Landing, Mays Landing, NJ",8/14/2017,5.0,"Amazing food! Great service! Only thing to say would be to call and make a reservation ahead of time, this place gets packed!"
Kirk M.,"Phoenix, AZ",11/21/2016,5.0,Hands down the best brunch I've ever eaten out...and I don't say that lightly. The hangover hash is everything you could dream of on a Sunday morning. Friendly staff and a great environment. This wasn't my first stop and it definitely won't be my last!
Phuong Thao P.,"Germantown, MD",10/23/2016,5.0,"I love the food here but because of that, it's always so crowded so try to make reservations! Service isn't bad but it can be a bit slow sometimes. We go here when we bike down the crescent trail. It's also close by to the water."
Craig F.,"Washington, DC",11/20/2016,3.0,"3 stars because my first experience here wasn't bad. Something seems to have gone wrong with the quality of their service. We had to wait a little bit even with reservations, no big deal, this place is always crowded. We ordered 2 appetizers and drinks after we sat down, and shortly after my drink arrived, so did our entrees. Our server clearly forgot to put in the order for our apps when we first asked for them.  Then,  my friend had ordered broccoli rabe as his side with his vegetarian meatloaf. The entree came out with 2 servings of mashed potatoes instead of 1 of each. We pointed out that we never got our appetizers, and that my friend didn't get his broccoli rabe. 10 minutes later, just as we were finishing our entrees, the appetizers finally arrived.  Also, the server told us there was no beer list, but then really didn't know how to answer ANY questions about the beer they did have.  Weird. We really thought they would take off a drink from our bill because of the poor service, but no dice.  The food is decent, but didn't at all make up for the poor service this time. Hopefully they will work on that."
Johnny W.,"Las Vegas Strip, NV",5/22/2016,3.0,Oh founding farmers what happened. I used to count this place as the number 1 brunch in DC. Oh what happened? The food is just mediocre now. It is not much better than IHOP. The menu is no longer super large and not much to choose from for breakfast. Over the course of our meal I tried the French toast. Too crunchy. The scrambler too oily. The hash browns not hashed enough. The founding farmers breakfast not great and the bacon too crunchy. The only positive is they gave us an extra minute on our reservation and we were seated right away. I am sorry ff but there are too many breakfast places to go in DC and you are no longer my go to place.
Melissa J.,"Odenton, MD",5/21/2016,5.0,Another Fabulous night at Founding Farmers... Arrived about 15 minutes prior to reservation so I can be seated at reservation time. I've been to this location quite a bit and it's my favorite out of all the other locations. Was sat upstairs in a booth which I prefer over the farm style tables. The food was delicious as always and the service was excellent. My favorite restaurant by far and the never disappoint. Nothing beats an authentic farm to table restaurant...
Michelle P.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/6/2016,4.0,"I don't want to give this place a 5 stars because of their hosts. Waiter service and food was great. Atmosphere and decor was great as well. It's just their hosts were the worst out of all.I got there a little over noon, I asked her how long is the wait for a table, she said 1-1.5hr. When my husband arrived we kinda debating whether to wait or just go somewhere else. Since the reviews was crazy about this place we decided to stay and wait.Not long after that I saw that they seat some people who came after us, later that we know they had a reservation, which is weird cause when we try to do a reservation they said NO reservation. We waited another 5-10mins and I saw them seat another couple who came after us, I went to the host and asked how long is it now? as its been 15mins after we arrived. She said the same thing 1-1.5hr. GUESS WHAT? a couple minutes later a waiter came out and calling my name table for 2, of course I said that's for me, cause there were no body else claim it. I don't know if the waiter made mistake or not but when the host saw me sitting down and sipping my tea she gave me the look like ""how the hell did you get seated already?"" hahahaha"
Lizzie C.,"Washington, DC",11/18/2016,3.0,"I brought a former coworker for lunch, with a 12:15 reservation. We arrived at 12:10 and were not seated until 12:30. Not the end of the world, but annoying when you have a reservation. The available area in which to stand while you wait was packed so people were constantly squeezing by one another...not a fun 20 minutes and a disappointment when you are trying to bring someone to lunch."
Matthew C.,"Irvine, CA",9/29/2016,3.0,"This place was ahead of it's time.  But to a certain extent, time has caught up.  Local the local ingredients but the dishes are just so-so with nothing really delicious."
Michael H.,"Elkridge, MD",5/17/2017,5.0,The food and the service were outstanding. The chicken and waffles were amazing.
Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",11/18/2015,5.0,"First, this place is just awesome. Amazing drinks, amazing food, amazing staff. You should go, twice if you can. Now if you want the details? They're below.I had a few handcrafted drinks at their prohibition era bar. I love whenever drinks are hand made and you can just ask for a type of liquor and then the bartender does their thing with style. First came a 'Devil went down to Georgia' which was (I think) bourbon, bitters, peach something, and chipotle syrup. It was hard to hear over the noise, but whatever was in it, it was delicious. And the chipotle on the end had a nice kick! 2nd drink came from a different bartender with rye, egg white, and a little chipotle. Not as awesome as the first one, but both were amazing. I ended up grabbing another 'Devil Went Down to Georgia' with a coworker after dinner.We all started with skillet cornbread, best eaten with a large group and it was phenomenal with the honey butter it came with. Also had bacon lollis which are fantastic thick cut bacon on skewers with a brown sugar glaze and completely sinful. A friend ordered the brie with apple and onion jam as her meal and I snuck a bite - so freaking good. Get this if you can!For dinner I was hard-pressed to choose but a friend who had been here before convinced me to have the slow braised short ribs. So well cooked they literally fell off the bone in tender pieces of deliciousness. It also had lemon candied green beans, which I thought would be terrible but ended with only the slightest citrus flavor. The mac n cheese (a random option not always on menu) was good, but paled in comparison to the other items. I was fortunate enough to have friends willing to share and can attest that the prime rib, chicken, pork chop, and cauliflower steak are all yummy as well. I wish we'd had the chance to go back before I had to leave DC, but maybe some day I can go back!"
Sharon C.,"Gambrills, MD",5/19/2016,4.0,"Advertised hours on the web and at the establishment differ. Call and make sure, especially if using Open Table to make reservations. My reservation was for 8:45 and the posted hours on the door state that they open at 9:00.Waited outside for a few minutes and the manager let everyone in and began seating. Polite and informative hostess who showed just the right amount of attentiveness w/o being annoying.When offered water, the glass presented had lipstick on it before I even touched it and it was quickly removed and replaced. Easy ordering and quickly recieved food w/a small swap in the type of bread I requested versus what was recieved. My food was good and I think I'd like to come back to either this location or another to sample more of their fare. I strongly recommend reservations because this is a popular eatery and you'll end up waiting and being hangry could affect your experience."
Michelle S.,"Towson, MD",2/7/2017,4.0,Awesome atmosphere. Obviously a little pricey but we'll worth it. I'm also not a huge mushroom person but the mushroom loaf was to die for. The mashed potatoes were also vegan and I could have eaten an entire order of them! Cocktails were also great and they definitely don't skimp on the booze either.
Sahar S.,"Court House, Arlington, VA",5/18/2016,5.0,A great lunch spot but its always packed and even if you have a reservation there is a bit of waiting time but i guess its worth it because the food is really delicious and its all organic
Laura M.,"Annapolis, MD",4/13/2016,5.0,"One word - BEIGNETS! They are absolutely delicious and are a must every time we go! We have only been for brunch, but have never been disappointed. Their menu is very diverse and has something for everyone. This is a really popular place, so make sure you make a reservation! The restaurant is decorated well and has a hip vibe. If you are in the DC area, be sure to check this place out! Tip 1: to be seated, you entire party has to be present. Tip 2: they only allow you a 15 minute grace period for reservations. So, try not to be too late :)"
Erica D.,"Milton, MA",5/6/2017,5.0,"What a great afternoon with two girlfriends!!! Bopping around D.C. For a couple of days and I looked up places for lunch around the Renwick. FF came up and sounded fun. It was 2 ish and the place was nicely full but not crazy. We ordered cocktails cuz that's what ya do on a Thursday afternoon right??!Then opted for a bunch of apps to share. Pickles. Awesome""Chips and Dips"" OMG! House made potato chips and 4 sauces to dunk them in yum!Sliders. Sooooo good and evil!Deviled eggs. Delish!!Fried green tomatoes. Good but the fry was a bit heavy and thick. Bread was really good and the Ernesto the Farmer cocktails rocked our world. I needed a nap but 2 more hrs of walking came first. How I managed it I don't know. My hubby still thinks Ernesto is some cute guy we met while away Private joke and we will never tell him it was a libation. Lovely service and very cool, hip, casual and classy space. The desserts that came to the table next to us look Amazeballs but ""we"" meaning my friends were too full. Oh well next time. This is a great place anytime of day. Go! And say hello to Ernesto for me. Lol"
Dasiga S.,"Toronto, Canada",5/16/2016,5.0,"One of the best breakfast places I've ever gone to. Server was also really pleasant and the atmosphere as a whole was really friendly. Ordered the hangover hash which was absolutely delicious- if you're up for an eggs benny with a twist. Everything was also pretty affordable, except for the orange juice. Ordered two glasses which came to $10. $5 for orange juice when the food is priced at $12-14 is a bit much. But overall I highly recommend this place. Make reservations early as this place fills up!"
LiLian B.,"Gainesville, FL",11/14/2016,5.0,"Breakfast heaven! I had the chicken and waffle, hunby had eggs benedict with sausage and gravy, kids had blueberry pancakes! Everything was amazing. My chicken was seasoned well and the white gravy was a good complement to the maple syrup I usually drench it with. Waffle was delicious as well!! There is a reason why this is highly rated. Believe the hype!"
Hillary L.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",6/10/2017,2.0,"After hearing so much hype we had to try Founding Farmers. Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The servers and atmosphere is great, but the food was super underwhelming. We tried the fried green tomatoes, the sliders, the mac & cheese, and the meatloaf. Everything was fine except for the meatloaf. I've never met a meatloaf I didn't like (let me say the word meatloaf one more time....) but this was one big dry hamburger patty. I'd recommend skipping Founding Farmers and trying something else. I definitely think this place is super hyped because of the typical 2-hour wait, and I honestly can't think of any other reason. Most locals don't understand it either. Oh well, you might have to see for yourself!"
M D.,"Charlotte, NC",5/27/2017,3.0,"Food is good, but customer service is a little shitty when twice we've been told what time we need to leave by while being seated....definitely won't be our first choice when dining out again."
Sarah F.,"New York, NY",12/23/2016,4.0,"So incredibly yummy. They have tons of great options for breakfast, me and my friends had an awesome time. Everything inside is picture perfect. Our server was a little strange, but other than that everything was awesome. I had the stuffed French toast and it was the best I've ever had. We also had the banana fluffer nutter which was to die for."
Craig Y.,"Londonderry, NH",7/25/2017,2.0,"One piece of bacon on bacon burger...huh?? Skimped on fries, half filled ketchup personal container. Not impressed"
Evan P.,"Washington, DC",4/10/2016,4.0,"Make sure to make a reservation. Farming Founders continues to be one of the  go-to restaurants in the city. Noted for its fresh, sustainable ingredients, Founding Farmers is popular for both the power weekday lunch and dinner crowd, and weekend brunch crowd. Service was good. Food was tasty and reasonably priced, and they have some great signature cocktails and an evolving beer list. Definitely worth a visit!"
Olivia V.,"Washington, DC",6/9/2017,5.0,"Love love love this place! Tableside guac is a must. Tastes so fresh and is consistently delicious. Bf got the jambalaya which he said was ""on point"" and I ft the poke salad which is always ahhhmazing. Our server Tim was attentive, funny, and welcoming. We'll be back!"
Richie H.,"Philadelphia, PA",11/12/2015,5.0,"This is DC's version of Cheesecake Factory or Grand Lux Cafe.  The most popular place on yelp in DC.  You'll need a reservation because it does get busy.  The menu is pretty ridiculous - lots of choices for drinks and plenty of options for food.  Ordered the homemade soda - lemon lime.  Tasted like a lemonade with club soda - tasty.Chicken and waffles are the top choice here.  The chicken skin is amazing and tastes similar to KFC, but better.  I got a thigh and breast.  Both were juicy and delicious.  You get Mac and cheese, a side and obviously waffles!  The waffles are light and buttery.  One of the best meals I've had in DC.   The decor is okay - like the sister restaurant better- farmers, fishers and bakers.  Both are good options, but there's a reason this is the number one hot spot"
Rachel T.,"Lexington, NC",8/1/2017,5.0,"It was my first visit and I have to say the food is defiantly worthy of the price. They defiantly give you more than enough food. The wait for Monday night was about an hour and half but that was okay, we just walked to the White House and Lincoln memorial and back. Our waiter was very nice and recommended some good dishes. I would recommend people to go here even if the wait may seem ridiculous lol"
Elizabeth B.,"London, United Kingdom",11/3/2016,5.0,"Let's start with the fact that they have Brie on their menu. I wouldn't need much else If I were reading that, 'cause I'd be sold there. BUT there's more, for appetizers I had the Brie farmers bread, bacon lollies, and the Spicy Tuna Ahi Poke Bowl (). Service was really friendly! I've heard people rave about brunch and you can bet I'll be back for that!"
Sally M.,"Washington, DC",3/21/2016,4.0,"A friend was in town, so I took today off work, and we all came here for lunch. Founding Farmers has been on my list to try since moving back here from SF, so we made it happen today. Since I'm eating low carbs, I sadly skipped some of their delicious delicacies; here's what I got:- Avocado Bacon Burger: delicious. Forgot to request it be lettuce wrapped. (Oops, my bad.) Automatically includes mayo (beware). If ketchup is desired, it needs to be requested. - Collard Greens: only found one ham hock, and sadly they were the worst collard greens I've ever had. :/ Lacking in flavor, and a bit dry. Surprisingly, even my own attempts at home proved better. Needs improvement.I love the quality ingredients, standards, and concept here + the interior design, so I will be returning to try more menu options. (Service was decent, but I could hardly hear our server; it was as if she was whispering.)"
Steph B.,"Winston-Salem, NC",5/12/2016,3.0,"Great things about Founding Farmers: Location can't be beat. Drink menu is interesting. Servers are friendly. The food is solid. They take reservations. Beignets make for a delicious brunch dessert. Meh things about Founding Farmers: The service has yet to blow my socks off. If you don't have a reservation, the wait can be for-eve-r. The food is better than average but not out of this world.I've been here a few times and would return but it's not worth a wait."
Kaity R.,"Carlsbad, CA",1/7/2017,5.0,Great brunch! Went in thinking I would have to eat off the sides menu as I'm vegan but was pleasantly surprised by the options. I chose the mushroom loaf with vegan mashed potatoes and the broccolini. It's been so long since I've had mashed potatoes and they were amazing. The rest of my table tried my mushroom loaf and they loved it too. My family ordered the carrot cake slice for dessert and it was huge. Looked delicious. Really happy that our server was helpful about vegan options.
Sandy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/19/2016,4.0,"I was super excited to try this particular restaurant after hearing from a couple of friends that this was ""THE"" restaurant to try while in DC so I made sure to get my reservations in super early for the time slot that I wanted and again, I'm so glad I did as the restaurant was super packed with people crowding the bar and hostess podium after I checked in. After a 15 or so minute wait, we were led to our table against the window so we could see what was happening outside (awesome seats!)Our waiter arrived and we placed our order for the following *note: no appetizer bread!!*:1) FARMHOUSE PLATTER - baby cheeseburgers | chili dog | pork ribs | fries | corn - best of all the worlds with a little bit of everything. the chili dog was okay but i enjoyed the chili the best - kinda reminded me of a good sloppy joe chili, pork ribs had a nice sweet glaze and fell off the bone, the corn was topped off some sort of cheese and chili powder which made it awesome. Definitely very filling for all the items you get to have with just a little bit of everything. 2) cauliflower steal & risotta (meatless) - pretty good; cauliflower was a bit burnt but, nonetheless, polished off.3) meat loaf & gravy, red potatoes & green beans - supposedly the ""must"" order  at this place; meatloaf size was huge and filling. Not really the best IMO.4) 3 baby cheeseburgers with a side of fries - decent sized burgers that will make you full; the burger patty was juicy and tender with a nice spread and cheese.The customer service here is good; not excellent, but good. He did come back and check on us occasionally but definitely not any more than that since I saw him being more friendly to the table next to us with their food coming out earlier than ours. There are two levels to the restaurant with the 2nd level being accessible by stairs (right at the front of the restaurant or by elevators in the back area past the bar in the middle of the restaurant). Thus, there are also bathrooms on both levels! Try the upstairs first since there isn't as much people up there as there are downstairs, so no line or lesser than downstairs. Bathroom is cutely decorated with little one liners printed all around the walls.Overall, I really enjoyed the food and will definitely be back if I am ever in the area! I will now be the one recommending this place to my friends who are planning trips out to the DC area (haha)."
Caroline K.,"Queens, NY",3/28/2016,5.0,"With 7000+ reviews, I knew I had to check this place out.  I've never been more relieved that I had made brunch reservations.  It was an absolute shitshow.  People were quoted two hour waits and they actually muscled through it!  There was a guy who we saw when we walked in and he was STILL standing there waiting when we left.Loved that we were seated upstairs away from all of the hullabaloo.  Right away we got to ordering.  My maple cured ham with eggs over easy was spot on and so delish.  My bf and I also split the blueberry pancakes and it was like a perfect dessert accompaniment.  The table next to us must've been inspired because they ordered the exact same thing to share as well.  Trendsetters, y'know?Definitely deserves all of its hype and more.  If I'm ever in town, I'd love to come back, with reservations of course."
Emily F.,"San Francisco, CA",10/31/2016,5.0,"Simply said, it's been a week and I'm still thinking about the Banana Fosters French Toast. One of, if not, the most delicious breakfast I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. Amazing."
Gwen D.,"Ashburn, VA",6/7/2017,5.0,I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was amazing! Best brunch I've had in a while!
Julie M.,"Louisville, KY",11/13/2016,4.0,"Had the Pan Scramble, which consisted of sausage, mushroom, spinach and cheese. It also has onion but I opted to leave those out. It came with grilled ciabatta and I did an upgrade on the side to the hot sauce bacon. The scramble was good, I really liked the sausage and the vegetables were crisp and fresh. The ciabatta was to die for, I could have easily eaten an entire loaf of that with zero guilt. The bacon, while really thick cut and meaty, was a bit of a disappointment, because it was just bacon with Tabasco brushed on. I dont know what I was expecting to get, but I mean come on, I paid like $4 extra for something I could have done myself at the table. Oh well, lesson learned.Otherwise the interior is huge, but comfortable and bright, and my server was quite punctual and professional. I would surely come back."
Rob O.,"Springfield, VA",5/23/2017,5.0,Great food/drinks/service! Always book a reservation. (I'm a big fan of the whiskey cocktails)
Anna H.,"Fredericksburg, VA",8/8/2017,2.0,Ehh was very disappointed with my experience here. Heard a lot of good things about it so went in with the intention of having an amazing meal. We were really looking forward to brunch and had made a reservation but by the time we were actually seated we missed he brunch window. One of the orders at our table was messed up and had to be remade and another person had found hair in their food.
Tina F.,"Woodstock, GA",5/2/2017,4.0,"Really enjoyed our meal at FF, interesting options, so many fun cocktails to chose. Definitely make a reservation in advance at peak times, very popular. Dress how ever you feel, up or down everyone fits in. Loses a star on my rating for noise. A little noisy and would be a big problem for folks with that sensitivity."
Daniel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/22/2017,5.0,I'm visiting from California and and didn't know where to go for dinner until I seen this place by my hotel. It is true about the long lines but I placed an order to go so it was quick.  I ordered the Chicken Pot pie and Cornbread skillet and it was pretty damn good. I couldn't finish my food and it was a good portion. Might stop here one more time before I believe.
Anna E.,"Midtown, Atlanta, GA",5/22/2017,5.0,"Dea is fantastic!! Request her when you come. We came here for a birthday meal and they were so easy to reserve a table with and they had candles ready for a birthday piece of cake. We tried the regular Reuben and I had the vegan Reuben, both 5/5!!!"
Amber B.,"Arlington, VA",6/4/2017,3.0,"This place is super popular, but I thought it was just okay. I'm gluten free and didn't want to ask our server a ton of questions, so it would have been better if they had gluten free items labeled on the menu.I ended up eating a burger without the bread. It was fine, but nothing special. I've been for brunch as well and it was the same - ok but nothing special. (Once again, I was limited in options and had an omelette because I can't do pancakes, waffles, etc.)"
Maggie M.,"Washington, DC",6/4/2017,5.0,"Founding Farmers rarely disappoints. The cucumber delight is fantastic (as are the rest of their cocktails). Cornbread is a must and there's really nothing on the menu you can go wrong with. For brunch, Farmers fishers is a better choice. But, for dinner, it's great!"
Steven B.,"Washington D.C., DC",5/21/2017,4.0,"I have been here for lunch a few times.  I recommend having a reservation as its always busy.  I like the salads, the burgers, and the creative homemade sodas.  Definitely worth a try if you are thinking about going."
Seth R.,"Doylestown, PA",7/15/2017,5.0,"Breakfast. Grits were fantastic. Perfectly fried sunny-side-up, pork sausage, coffee, actual fresh squeezed orange juice."
Christine F.,"Milwaukee, WI",3/27/2016,5.0,Make a ressie for sure! Ours was at open on a Saturday at nine. It is a bit pricey but the portions are huge! No decaf coffee? So I got a $4.00 upcharge for an Americano. The beneights are a must at $8.00. They come in a bag with three different sauces. The stuffed french toast was awesome. My eggs and hashbrowns were just average at $9.00. It was $65 for the four of us.
Ben P.,"Harrington Park, NJ",2/20/2017,3.0,Very average. Big loud young people's sophisticated fast food. The food was descent with a big menu. Kind of a Jazzed up Friday's. We had a great server named Claire. She was the best server on the D.C. Trip. The restaurant was almost like a healthy Cracker Barrel. Not in a rush to go back.
Smitcha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/22/2016,4.0,"1. Make reservations. Trust me. Regardless day or night.2. Make the reservations for brunch especially. Brunch menu is simple but on point and it won't break your Bad Mother F*cka wallet. 3. Uncle Buck's Beignets ($8). Six in an order. If they have it, order it. Doesn't matter if it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Just do it. They're not like NOLA's Café Du Monde style, but their version left a lasting impression. I ordered this twice in one weekend. Yes, that means I ate here twice in a single weekend. Didn't care for the chocolate sauce but the raspberry and caramel sauce paired together in perfect harmony. I do miss it.4. The brunch chicken-apple sausage was surprisingly good. WTF is all I can say (in a good way). So get it as a side. I will warn you, it looks quite heinous. I thought it was a pickle at first but I can assure you that the taste is orgasmic. 5. The crab benedict ($14). You don't even need the hollandaise sauce. I typically ask for this on the side anyway and it was fan-f-ing-tastic without it. Lumps of crab meat.Service was on point (Thanks Elliot). French press coffee was bold. Food tasted fresh and clean like the ingredients were directly from the farm. Didn't feel all bloated after our meal. If you're dining during lunch, check out that ahi tuna poke salad. Catchy taste.Them beignets though. Urgh!"
Anna A.,"Shreveport, LA",5/9/2017,5.0,"My husband and I went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. Be sure you have a reservation - we did. But, there was a line to get in the door and be seated. Everything was delicious. Most popular dish is chicken and waffles. We had eggs Benedict, waffle & beignets. Would recommend any of it again. Can't wait to go back."
Christina O.,"Midlothian, VA",9/25/2016,4.0,I had a waffle that was very good! I would definitely eat another waffle there.  Now the meat. You have an option from the meat platter for an extra $6 (I think it was).  I ordered ham and did not recognize gravy came on top. I don't eat gravy so that ruined the ham for me.  My dfh ate what he could of it but he ordered the chick and waffles and that was filling him up.  The chicken was really good! I ended up eating some of his chicken. Next time I go... I know.
Nikki D.,"Las Vegas, NV",5/8/2017,4.0,This place was great. Everything is farm fresh and delicious. I had the chicken pot pie and it was truly amazing. The best pot pie I've every had. The wait was a pretty long and I ended up snagging a seat at the bar.
Ashley F.,"Orlando, FL",5/20/2017,5.0,"Every time I've come to D.C., this is a must! We absolutely love their food! Everything is so fresh and since it's a scratch kitchen they can accommodate all of your needs! If you're staying anywhere near this place, you need to make reservations!"
Courtney N.,"Manhattan, NY",10/21/2016,5.0,I've been to this place twice. Once for brunch the other for dinner. Both times now I've had an amazing dining experience. I ordered the cauliflower steak & risotto for dinner. tbh each bite I took into the risotto made me feel like the character Shrek in the movie where he was running in the flower field. V good stuff. would recommend. 10/10!
Robert F.,"Irvine, CA",3/18/2016,3.0,"First, let me tell you that I wanted to really love this restaurant. I had reservations for 5 and arrived early, I was asked if everyone in my party was also there and I replied ""No"". The balance arrived in about 10 minutes and alerted them. While waiting I kept noticing that the maitre'd search for their parties. I'd love to make a suggestion, write down what your guest are wearing or an identifiable fact making it easy to spot them versus bothering everyone around yelling out their name every minute. My experience with the hostess, started off great, however quickly soured given it had been 20 minutes passed out reservation time and 25 minutes passed when we mentioned everyone had arrived. Rather than simply apologize for the wait one of the hostesses becomes more confrontational escalates my questions about timing into a defensive rant about how it had only been 20 minutes since they arrived and the other time I had been waiting doesn't matter. That's not a problem but I only went to ask how much longer for the table and had been in a great mood because I really had been  wanted to love this place. Moving on, we get seated shortly after, and the restaurant management should make it a point to their staff that cleanliness should be made a significant priority. We sat at a bar height table in the rear and there were crumbs under the table as well as in the canal of the legs of the table(see pics) as well as the bathroom was clearly not regularly checked (sorry...also see pic). Also, one of the knives was dirty although set as a new knife. As for the food, I ordered the shrimp and grits, my wife ordered the pot roast, steak & enchiladas, my son the chicken and waffles. The flavor of my shrimp and grits( I requested extra spicy) was very good although I was immediately turned off by the shrimp which hadn't been cleaned properly(see pics), but maybe just an over sight as the others appeared to be(something I think whoever served the food should have caught. The steak and enchiladas where very good as was the chick and waffles. The steak was well prepared and the flavor of the chimichuri sauce delicious. The chicken was seasoned very well and remained moist inside. I didn't try the waffles but son seemed to enjoy them. As for the pot roast, it came out cold was returned and they made a new one which was my wife enjoyed. STARTERS : we had the skillet cornbread, the bacon lollipops and the deviled eggs. All very good and flavorful. DRINKS: Founders Sour - Excellent, my wife had a monitor looking drink that was beautiful which had a bit too much bitters as a float. If not for the filth was around us, and the initial experience with the hostess this may have been a 4 star and possibly even a 5. DESERT: we had the apple pie a la mode and the chocolate mousse. Both were excellent. In fact, I will say the apple pie was amongst the better ones I've ever had. See my pics."
Andrew P.,"Palos Park, IL",7/27/2017,4.0,Stopped for weeknight dinner.  Was seated quickly evdn without a reservation.  Mojitos and dinner were fantastic.
Sab T.,"Exeter, NH",8/31/2017,5.0,"Definitely would recommend making a reservation in advance - came in on a Wednesday night for dinner but still ended up waiting a little over an hour for a table for 2. If you're in the mood for a drink and feeling adventurous I would order a dealer's choice - you choose what kind of liquor and flavor profile (sweet, bitter, sour, etc) and the bartender will create a cocktail based on your preferences! Food was also delicious, we ordered the fried tomatoes, bacon lollis and cornbread to start. The cornbread was my favorite, there was actual corn at the bottom of the cornbread and the honey butter that came with it was amazing. Not a huge fan of bacon and fried things but my bf wanted to try them as they were popular. Bacon lollis were surprisingly good, not overly greasy or mostly fat like bacon usually is, and the fried tomatoes were okay for me (bf thought they were really good) so I guess it's just based on what you like/prefer. For entrees we got the Farmhouse Platter and the Shrimp and Sundried Tomato Bucatini. The platter was nothing too special in terms of flavor (chili dog, hamburger sliders, potato salad, corn on the cob, ribs)  but it was still good and is good if you like variety. The pasta was really good however, and was my bf's favorite. There was a good amount of shrimp and it was a creamy tomato based sauce that had a bit of a spicy kick to it. Overall, food was fresh and filling, employees were friendly, and restaurant ambience is nice for a lively date night out or for drinks with friends."
Christina G.,"Arcadia, CA",9/8/2015,5.0,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday during Labor Day weekend and it was packed beyond belief. I had reservations for 10:15am, we checked in at 10am and we still had to wait 25 minutes to get a table. After I saw that a group that came in after us got seated before us, I asked them why we haven't gotten seated yet and it was because the guy didn't even check us in -_-. Good thing I checked in with them a second time otherwise we would have had to wait forever. But we got seated right afterwards anyways. Food here is so delicious! I literally wanted to try everything on their menu, but we couldn't order too much because we had a lot of tourist things to do and couldn't bring food inside those places. They don't have a big selection of food, but the portions they give you are pretty big and filling. Strawberry stuffed French toast: OMGGGG BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER! I've never had stuffed French toast and now I don't think I will ever go back to regular French toast. The outer layer was crispy, but very oily =| I suggest sharing this dish because eating three pieces of extremely oily and fried French toast doesn't sit well with the stomach. The filling is a vanilla cream and it was delicious. Must find other places in LA that have stuffed French toast. Scrambled eggs with sausage and hashbrowns: my boyfriend ate the sausage and he said it was yummy. Their hashbrowns are pretty good, but not the best I've had, their eggs, HANDS DOWN the best eggs I've had at a restaurant. I think because the eggs weren't dry at all, and it had a good texture to it. Hangover hash: poached egg over hashbrowns and meat. I ate the poached egg and it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely try their eggs benedict if I am ever back in town. I didn't try their meat, but my boyfriend said it was pretty good."
Steph P.,"Coventry, RI",8/5/2017,5.0,"This was my first visit to DC and as someone who enjoys experiencing the local culinary scene when I vacation, I spent two hours researching top restaurants in the city and making reservations at some of the top rated. One of those places was Founding Farmers. I had such amazing amazing experience there that i just had to try Farmers and Distillers for breakfast  which was equally amazing and ended up cancelling all of my other reservations for the rest of the week to try their waterfront restaraunt, Farmers Fishers Bakers for dinner. You can say that I was more than impressed with this restaraunt group. Amazing amazing amazing place to be in DC: clean, upbeat and casual atmosphere. They make everything from scratch and it doesn't get any fresher!  The cornbread in a skillet is a must; it's sooo good. We are trying to eat vegetarian and their meatless options are honestly the best we've ever had. The mushroom Ruben and veggie burger with cranberry were culinary sensations.  It isn't often that I am impressed with the entire dining experience at a restaraunt.  To top off the incredible food,  the service we received at each Farmers establishment was friendly, knowledge and courteous. Additionally, for the amazing quality and innovative dishes the prices were quite reasonable especially being in a big city. One other note is that each Farmers restaurant has dishes unique to them so while some overlap each has its own character. Definitely Check out one or all Farmers amazing restaraunts if you're in DC you will not be disappointed. Make sure to make reservations they fill up and rightfully so!"
Jessica S.,"Philadelphia, PA",6/23/2016,5.0,"I made a reservation a day before, which was surprising since the day I made it for was for Saturday. Found at 10:30am for 2 and so we didn't have to wait at all. So make sure to make a reservation ahead of time. Got the chicken and waffle and my friend got the breakfast plate. Although I don't have much to compare to, the chicken and waffle was DELICIOUS. My friend thoroughly enjoyed his breakfast plate as well - included eggs, chicken sausages. I also got the coffee and the donuts and it was really good. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole meal. I would definitely come back. Just make sure you make a reservation! I think it makes a ton of difference!"
Max O.,"Washington, DC",5/18/2017,3.0,"Honestly, I don't see what all the hype is about. By the way people talk about this restaurant, you'd think the gods themselves descended to make slightly-overpriced American food.When I went, I got the roast chicken which, don't get me wrong, was good. But does it justify having to get a reservations days in advance and waiting for 30 minutes to be seated when you get there? Probably not. Overall, when your folks are in town, take them to a less trendy, more delicious spot."
Marcus C.,"Pennsylvania Furnace, PA",5/31/2017,5.0,"Founding Farmers was an AMAZING American cuisine experience in DC. I made my reservation a month in advance and changing the time or adding another guest in afterward was extremely difficult... I HIGHLY advise making your reservation ahead of time. This place did not disappoint. Very wholesome, savory, and good quality American food. The portions were very fairly sized -- not too much to overstuff you but not too little so that you get your money's worth.I highly recommend the cornbread. The recipe was delicious; there were real corn bits in the bread itself. Very buttery, smooth and fulfilling. The rest of the food on the menu is what you can expect from an American cuisine -- rotisserie chicken, chicken and waffles, pasta... typical sides like mac n' cheese, string beans and potatoes. Although it was typical American food, it was NOT average quality. It was spectacular! The service was attentive, speedy and very polite. The food came out promptly. The atmosphere is elegant despite being a casual restaurant and very family friendly. It was extremely crowded and busy so you could definitely feel a fast-paced environment around you. Lines for the bathroom did form.Overall, great place to dine if you're visiting DC. I highly recommend! Just don't forget to book your reservation much in advance."
Christina B.,"Winter Park, FL",11/12/2016,5.0,"Worth the wait! A must try for those visitors to the area. Most people reviewed the dinner menu and that certainly looks incredible but we were able to fit this in for brunch. OMG yes. So good. I had the best veggie scramble I've ever had in my life. It had carrots in it. Cooked perfectly, not runny. Came with incredible hash browns and an English muffin. I basically licked the plate. I also had a Bloody Mary ...so good, very spicy, but very flavorful! Hubs had the Bananas Foster waffle. It was pretty epic. Very filling and definitely share-able. He said the coffee was good too The place is very trendy. The bar top is like concrete block looking. Very cool. Makes you feel like a local being there. I saw so many people come in and take food to-go so I gather locals really do love it too. Next trip to DC we will certainly try dinner."
Noble K.,"Sugar Land, TX",4/26/2016,4.0,"I can see why this place is so popular. I got to try a few different items because i ate family style with a group of friends.  Prosciutto Cornbread, Chicken Bolognese, Chicken and Waffles, Steak and Enchiladas, and Shrimp and Grits.  Prosciutto cornbread first of all is must order to start your meal!  It was simply awesome.  Out of the other dishes they were all pretty solid but I thought the Fried Chicken and Waffles was easily the best dish (5/5)Overall, this place seemed to hit the farm to table concept out of the ballpark and our meal in general was great.  Highly recommend making reservations."
Jasmine W.,"Washington, DC",5/31/2017,4.0,"Everything here is delicious. unfortunately, the wait time is usually at least 30minutes to an hour without a reservation. The food is made fresh and the flavors are very bold. Their sister restaurants are just as good."
Hala S.,"Alexandria, VA",9/26/2016,4.0,"We had the Farmers Salad, chicken and waffles and the corn bread. The food was outstanding and so was the service ... I deducted a star for uncleanliness, our knives and water glasses were stained and had funky smell. That said, my overall experience was very good and I'd certainly come back."
Carlyne M.,"Jacksonville, FL",9/8/2015,5.0,"I found this place on Yelp and decided that we must come here on our visit to DC. Founding Farmers ended up being our first stop fresh off the plane. We made reservations for 4 at 1015 on Saturday, and we were so glad we did! We heard the hosts tell walk-ins it was a two hour(!) wait. We were seated about 5 minutes after we checked in and we were able to fit our luggage underneath the table and our chairs :) Every. Single. Item. that we ordered was phenomenal. We ordered beignets, chicken and waffles, bourbon batter French toast, strawberries and cream waffles, and bananas foster waffles. Oh, and a side of bacon. Did I mention that everything was amazing? My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The DH and my friend's BF both ordered Bloody Marys that were delicious and satisfying. I, of course, ordered sweet tea and was so excited to see that they served it there. My friend ordered a coffee soda(?) that she seemed to love. FF made it on our ""definitely a must visit every time we go to DC"" list. I would be willing to take a 2 hr flight up there every weekend just to eat there if I could. It's just that good."
Juan G.,"Alexandria, VA",2/12/2017,4.0,"Second time I come here, food was amazing. Service could have been better. Definitely get a reservation there is always a line."
Alexis B.,"Washington, DC",8/13/2015,4.0,"Whenever I'm in the mood for some fresh, savory American comfort food or handcrafted cocktails, I think of Founding Farmers. Plus those decadent desserts are unmatched and meatless options keep me coming back. This flagship location has been popular among foodies and casual diners for years and for good reason! I've dined here numerous times with minimal disappointment- aside from the wait if I forget to make a reservation. Most times, I sit at the bar to be entertained by the mixologists who respond to requests like ""Make me something fun"" with grace. They got mad skills crafting tasty cocktails that are also beautiful. Some of my favorite signature dishes include:-Cedar plank salmon-Chicken & Waffles-Chicken pot pie-Chicken salad-Butternut squash mascarpone ravioli-Starters: Fried green tomatoes & Devilish Eggs-Crop list sides: mac-n-cheese & mint watermelonThe upbeat atmosphere keeps the noise level in the entire restaurant high, but it's a little better upstairs. Founding Farmers-DC is solid and yields an enjoyable experience every time.+Don't forget to ask about the sides that aren't listed on the menu.++Postpone all Secret Squirrel conversations since the tables are so close"
Chris W.,"Houston, TX",4/2/2017,2.0,"WAAAAAY overhyped and overrated.We came Friday at 9:30 pm as a party of five - our family foodie from NY saw the rave reviews and booked a reservation for our first night in DC. Impressed at the lively, bustling crowd as we made our way to the table, we were very much ready for a great meal.We had a fantastic waitress who was responsive to our questions and my dairy allergy. She, along with the fragrant, pillowy cornbread skillet, were the highlights of the night. Our drinks were hit-and-miss - the strawberry phosphate was pretty cool and tasty, but the lemon-lime and ginger sodas seemed watered down. And we had complaints about all of our main dishes:-The shrimp and grits were very unbalanced - in general, the grits were extremely salty (like, you had to chug a glass of water after each bite), and in some places there were these little bombs of spiciness. Mixing didn't help. -Two of us ordered the pork loin sandwich - mine was made sans dairy, so it came without cheese and on a different bread. But both were dry and mostly tasteless. The ciabatta-like bread on which the original sandwich was made was so thin and chewy that it was probably underbaked...-The pork ribs and beef short rib were tougher than expected - and since three of us are Texans, we have very high standards for BBQ...liked the coffee rub on the ribs though.-The pork-lentil stew was very homogeneous and mushy...it lacked texture and richness, and the egg on top was already cooked through SOLID by the time it reached our table (depriving us of that beautiful, dripping yolk). It's the end of our trip now and we all agreed that this meal was the most disappointing. Wouldn't give them a second chance."
Alan D.,"San Jose, CA",9/1/2015,5.0,"If you're in D.C. YOU NEED TO GO HERE.I was in D.C. for a work conference and while stumbling around town, my group got tired and hungry. What are we to do? Yelp stuff, obviously. Making reservations with Founding Farmers is actually really easy since they partner up with Yelp and OpenTable.We set our reservation for 7:30pm. We arrived at 7. They seat us at 7:10pm.When we initially got there, we browsed around the bar just to get a taste of the menu and see what the deal was all about. According to their staff, their menu changes based on the farmers harvest for that year... now that's freaking cool. I don't know why this concept isn't in California yet!Anyways, I ordered this amazing blackberry sour with egg white as my first drink of many drinks that night. What I really enjoyed about that drink was that it tasted like a whiskey sour, but it had hints of eggwhite (obviously) and blackberry (again, obviously), AND A HINT OF CINNAMON (WOAH DUDE).So we were seated promptly and got to our orders almost immediately. The chicken and waffles were just freaking calling my name man, I HAD to do it. We also ordered chicken wings and this amazing cornbread that came with a honey syrup... oh god.The dinner was absolutely phenomenal! The chicken was slapped with this amazing gravy and the waffles were Belgium styled (so that just means they're sweeter or whatever I guess) and good god. JUST STAHP. It was honest to god one of the most satisfying dinner's I've ever had. I initially didn't think it was enough food, but while trying to finish it, it dawned on me that it was a LOT of food and super satisfying.The staff is amazing, the decor is fabulous, the drinks are amazing, AND THE FOOD IS OFF THE HOOK. GO HERE!!"
Shauna M.,"Sunrise, FL",1/13/2017,3.0,"Had to visit this place considering the hype! Had a 10:30am reservation and arrived on time. We were presented with the lunch menu....when asked why not breakfast, we were told that it was almost 11 so the chefs are changing over! What the hell!?! After going back and forth, we got the menu. The food was ""pretty""! French toast was BOMB but the eggs were greasy....fresh orange juice...overall food was good but greasy....who knows maybe the chef was pissed!"
Gene B.,"Sterling, VA",5/4/2017,5.0,"It's a rare feeling to go to a restaurant, and not be able to think of one thing that could have been better about your dish. This place got everything right, even their freakin water, they give your table a pitcher of water,  with A grade ice cubes (you'll know what i'm talking about when you see it). This place is tremendous value for the quality of food you get and generous portions."
Tony S.,"Chicago, IL",9/28/2016,5.0,"It is not surprising that this fixture of DC Americana garners and maintains a solid four out of five star rating with over 8,400 Yelp reviews...simply a fantastic restaurant. Had a bit of trouble at first finding a seat during lunch here on a Wednesday, but quickly lucked upon a seat at the end of the bar. Had a nice conversation with the gentleman sitting to my right (he claimed to be a regular and offered me his untouched sandwich!)...he was telling me stories about Abu Dhabi and the tech sector and the new generation of young people there nowadays, something like that you know? Amazing how international our nation's capital can be, and the sorts of people one encounters by happenstance. Good food (try the items with crab), good service. Nice to have a bag with the box to take outside and finish later :) will be back!"
Brian B.,"Washington, DC",5/29/2017,5.0,Amazing drink quality and selection. Food is top notch and can really tell the difference in quality from other spots. When I have friends in town who haven't been to DC before this is the place I take them to.
Kold W.,"Seattle, WA",12/18/2016,4.0,Founding Farmers was a perfect lunch locale whilst in the Capital. Holla at thethe 'Prez' then hit up the trendy yetdelectable restaurant. Regarded asa local fave this did not disappoint.although our waiter seemed a bit'lethargic' the Food was Vibrantand the Drinks Refreshing. All Locally Sourced. Impressive without Pretension.

Updated review",5.0,"As promised, Amy had Jeff reach out to me today to again apologize for our experience and to remedy the experience as much as the restaurant could.  Thank you, Amy and Jeff for reaching out and being good representatives for your business.  So, 5 stars for customer service.  We would gladly try Founding Farmers DC the next time we are in town and to recommend it, because they have shown that they do care about customers' experience."
Kia D.,"Washington, DC",2/29/2016,3.0,"Review 7303Sooooo I've been here a handful of times. The first time I was excited, made a reservation for brunch, ready to taste the farm to table food and just have an awesome experience.We still had to wait to be seated.  Street parking.   It was insanely crowded. We waited outside as the weather was pleasurable. The food was good. People were taking pictures of their plates. The brunch combos that they offer all seem to be missing something.  Outside of those few options, all of the other food was a la carte (at about $8-$10+ per item)-- Fried green tomatoes were good.  It was cool, but no place I was rushing back to.  I had my ok experience.. next!Since my first experience, friends enjoy coming here on Sundays, so I stick to beignets and a drink.  The drinks are GOOD, but pricey.   It seems like people come here because it's the hip thing to do which actually turns me off.  I don't enjoy the crowded spaces, ridiculous waits, searching downtown streets for parking, paying a la carte for items I want... ehhh 3 stars."
Sue Z.,"Lexington, KY",7/17/2017,5.0,"My favorite place for breakfast in D.C. Go early or make s reservation, it gets crowded.  I've tried multiple fishes and all are great. Coffee is exceptional."
E M.,"Grand Junction, CO",7/17/2017,5.0,"Fantastic. I can see why this place is so busy and you need reservations. So, so good. We had a delicious homemade squash ravioli and the pot roast."
Caitlin B.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",5/15/2017,5.0,I cannot say enough good things about this place! We had a 2:30 reservation here last Sunday but something came up at that time so we decided to head over there earlier and see if we could snag something at the bar. We told the host our situation and he immediately offered to move our reservation up to 12:30! Perfect! We had a great meal topped off with the beignets for dessert (yum!) and really enjoyed the service (and how affordable it was) as well! This might sound weird but the bathrooms are also beautiful and they had mrs Meyers soy candles burning and I wish I looked at which scent it was because now I want to order them for home. Will be back!!
Sadaf S.,"Palo Alto, CA",5/3/2017,5.0,One of my favorites in the area! They have delicious food and friendly staff - I've never been disappointed! They do have a long wait but it's easy to make a reservation on OpenTable beforehand!
Hannah S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2/7/2017,4.0,Came here for the carrot cake but ended up grabbing a bite to eat as well once we saw all of the food. Had to wait quite awhile around 5pm on a Saturday but worth the wait. The carrot cake is HUGE but delicious. Chucks of carrot in the cake and cream cheese icing. Served with ice cream as well. The gnocchi is to die for- very flavorful dish that leaves you very full and satisfied. Order with a side of Brussels sprout to balance the heaviness with something green. Also delicious.
Emilee W.,"Bedford, VA",1/8/2017,4.0,Great atmosphere with reasonably priced and great food! My boyfriend and I both got the farmers breakfast! Super fresh!!
Amy P.,"Alexandria, VA",10/17/2016,5.0,"Always delicious and always has interesting food. I tried the chicken and waffles and a side of watermelon and mint and macaroni and cheese. Not a fan of the watermelon but everything else was amazing. It was so much food I had enough for leftovers. A bit pricey as usual but I never mind since it is so unique and it focuses on local, sustainable food."
Stacy F.,"Norcross, GA",7/16/2017,5.0,"Loved this restaurant! Amazing food, the best we've had this weekend in D.C. Service was excellent. The bacon lollies are delicious. I ordered the ribeye with green beans and spinach.  The steak was perfectly cooked medium and the sides were yummy. My boyfriend loved the mac and cheese. Definitely make a reservation if you don't want a 45min+ wait."
Hillary M.,"Seattle, WA",4/16/2017,4.0,"Don't go without a reservation! Good portions, comfy booths - nicely sourced meals. We've been here everytime we visit DC. Worth it - take your time and enjoy the menu."
Anitha K.,"Manhattan, NY",9/19/2015,4.0,I love the decor here!!! Great atmosphere. Start off with the cornbread! The salted butter and honey make it special. The chicken pot pie was delicious and was served pipping hot! (Had to wait a while for it to cool down).
G. S.,"Sacramento, CA",11/25/2016,3.0,"Founding Farmers is all the rage right now in DC, and with a cute name, great location (this review is for the DC location), and a good concept (I won't rewrite their story, but do read the ""about"" on their website), it'll probably be the rage for a while longer. Make sure you have a reservation. It's crowded for breakfast, lunch and dinner so just showing up isn't a smart plan. You'll be hard pressed to travel to DC and ask about dinner choices without someone enthusiastically mentioning ""Founding Farmers."" Coming from California where farm-to-fork is huge, I was looking forward to my next DC visit. I should say, in California farm-to-fork has taken a decidedly craft and artisan feel. You can get it on a budget, but a lot of farm-to-fork (or farm-to-table) is top shelf in terms of vegetables, beef, fish, fruits, etc. There is a great deal of care taken in selection, preparation, presentation and pairing (the wines and beers are carefully chosen to also represent the farm-to-glass concept, complimenting the meals perfectly). I have to say I was mistakenly expecting that with Founding Farmers given the way people talked about it. However, it's really much more down-home, which is also a very legitimate expression of farm-to-table. It's a spin on southern food here with a little bit of the portions of Claim Jumper thrown in. The service is friendly and attentive. No complaints here. The atmosphere is loud, energetic, with people clearly enjoying the meals and talking about the meals. The food itself, as stated, is a spin on southern cooking. Things can be saucy, really sweet, really salty, and generally flavorful in a somewhat unrefined way. For example, the glazed bacon lollis (lollipops) are a popular item.  They're super sweet, so much so that it takes a while to get the taste out of your mouth. As you might imagine, that can make things hard to pair with a wine, and indeed, the wine list is certainly not one designed for precise pairing (I love Duckhorn, but I just won't put their merlot up against some of the strong salty flavors of this food and expect to enjoy the wine - stick with a zinfandel or a riesling here). I have to say that the food itself wasn't that memorable. It was okay, not bad, but not that great. I can't recall the steak I ordered (the steaks at nearby Charlie Palmer, for example, are much better). The dessert was mousse and it was literally a giant bowl of mousse. It says ""for two"" on the menu, but I can't even imagine eating half of it. Sometimes less is more and where they impress with the huge size, the actual flavor and texture of the mousse was so-so. Again, not bad, but not that good either. (Being celiac I couldn't try them, but the clear favorite of the place was the Uncle Buck's Beignets. As is the theme, one order was so much that the people at the table next to us offered to share because there was no way they could eat them all. They seemed to like them well enough, but as with the mousse, I have to wonder if the scale of the offering outweighed the actual flavor.) The cocktail list should be mentioned and the servers definitely push the mixed drinks. They do a good job of coming up with some options for a wide range of tastes, but perhaps calling them ""craft"" is a stretch.   In all, it's a fun place to go if you want to see what the hype is all about. I actually think they'd do great in Sacramento, CA, which has declared itself ""America's Farm-to-Fork Capital."" Californians in Sacramento might appreciate the ""home"" feel of Founding Farmers to compliment some of their other farm-to-fork restaurants.UPDATE: I did hear back from Founding Farmers after posting this review, and it's clear that they take their product and their Yelp reviews very serious. This is probably the reason they're so successful, and it's attention to details like this that would make me now want to give them another visit next time I'm in DC. I still think they'd be a huge hit in Sacramento."
Jeremy M.,"Modesto, CA",11/12/2016,5.0,"Service was great, food was great. Rye was okay... Dessert was OUTSTANDING!! Definitely somewhere you're going to want reservations... Try the carrot cake. And the apple pie.... and the ice cream.... seriously, just come hungry and leave room for dessert!"
Ravi B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",7/31/2015,5.0,"Out of all the restaurants I tried in DC, this was my absolute favorite. From the moment I walked in, to the moment I left I had a great experience. While we were waiting for our table, I was able to check out their lobby. They have a bunch of books available to read while waiting that feature farm-to-table freshness or about food in general. It resonates with their true food theme. It seems like the restaurant is busy at all times. I love how the bar is square and in the middle of the restaurant rather than at a side. After sitting down, I was already overwhelmed with all the amazing choices! I texted Justin for recommendations, but I didn't follow any of his :P. I ended up choosing a prosciutto bread and my cousin got a corn bread skillet. The corn bread was so soft! It came with a salty-butter which made it even better. The prosciutto bread was also awesome! It had figs and cheese on it too so it was a great start to the meal. I tried their ""Constitution"" drink too with blueberry and lemon. Such a great mix! They really know their cocktails at Founding Farmers.I was already full before getting my entrée: Fried Chicken Salad. The chicken tenders were flavorful, soft, and fresh. I actually didn't really like the salad part of it, just the chicken. But I could see myself liking some of their burgers and sandwiches. My cousin got the shrimp louis cobb salad and it looked like it was great. She agreed that she would not get a salad again, but she has been to Founding Farmers before. For dessert, we tried their warm beignets! I loved the raspberry sauce it came with. It also comes with chocolate and caramel. But all I needed was to douse my beignet in lots of raspberry. Love this place!"
Alex T.,"Washington, DC",8/2/2017,4.0,"I've lived in DC for nearly 5 years, and regularly bring out of town visitors to Founding Farmers. I've been to brunch, happy hour, and dinner several times over the years. The food is always solid (only once did my husband get something neither of us cared for), and the prices are what should be expected for the area. My only complaint is the wait times I've encountered even with a reservation. I've never been sat close to my reservation time. I was a hostess and then manager at a busy restaurant for 3+ years, so I am very understanding when it comes to flipping tables --- tables won't always be available when they need to be! However, the wait time should never be 40+ minutes for a person who has a reserved table. Thankfully they have good cocktails, and those keep me happy until my table is available!"
Niki X.,"Houston, TX",4/16/2017,5.0,"I would definitely recommend this as a place to stop if visiting DC. The food is fantastic, the drinks aren't the best though. The crab cakes are probably the best I've ever tried, it's almost all crab with very little breading. The sides are all great, but the mac and cheese stuck out above the others. Be sure to make reservations though!"
Faithful N.,"Kensington, MD",4/9/2016,5.0,This place is everything that is amazing in homemade comfort food! The atmosphere is exciting and unique! The food is out of this world. Yes it's very simple recipes but it's made with wonderful ingredients and served with great care. Everything was wonderful here! Definitely a place to indulge and enjoy yourselves. You're taste buds will thank you.
John C.,"Ormond Beach, FL",2/29/2016,4.0,"Call for reservations!!!  We walked up at 2:30pm on Sunday and waited till 4:15 to sit.  They do not have a beeper system or texting software or any other way to tell you they are ready except one of the hostesses walked around and calls out your name.  Once seated the waiter was there to take our drink order.  The breads come as 3 slices (3""x10"" about) with the topping group you ordered.  Very similar to brochette but soft. Great start.  The meals were great (Blue cheese ravioli with chicken cutlets.  The waiter forgot my wine and my water glass had lipstick on it so they comped the wine and the bread without me asking for anything other than another glass.Overall a great experience.  We may return during our visit but I will make reservations next time."
Connie L.,"New York, NY",4/4/2016,4.0,"Came here last weekend during peak cherry blossom time and some how managed to make a rsvp the night before.We arrived a little before our reservation time of 11:30am on Sunday. The restaurant is two stories and makes great use of the high ceilings to make it feel super open and lofty. The decor is also really nice. After a little wait, we were seated upstairs. Coming from Manhattan, my friend and I thought it'd be fun to order the Manhattan (coffee, espresso, soda, agave, whipped cream). It tasted delicious! But we drank it too quickly, so we also ordered a coffee. My friend got the chicken and waffle - chicken was moist and waffle was light yet had this perfect crispness to it. I got the beef pastrami hash because I really wanted hash. The portion was really filling and I was stuffed by the end of it.The waitress was nice and super helpful with describing the food items."
Michelle N.,"San Jose, CA",4/4/2016,4.0,"4 stars is pretty accurate!!! I'd heard great things about Founding Farmers brunch and was looking forward to trying their dinner. We made a reservation via Open Table and were so glad we did bc this place is slammed for dinner!!Love the decor and vibe of the place. Our waiter was ok - I was truly too engrossed in conversation to remember much of the service, unfortunately.We tried:-chicken and waffles x2: the boys both enjoyed their meals and said the chicken was tender-long roasted pork chop w/green beans and red whipped potatoes: this was good but I thought the pork chop was waaaay too salty-blue ribbon apple pie w/ice cream: this is hands down the biggest slice of apple pie that I've ever received at any restaurant!! It was delicious too-Fraise fling: yummy but strong strawberry-flavored cocktailFounding farmers is delicious with extremely huge and generous portions. Definitely worth a stop!"
Lillian C.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/12/2016,5.0,"I highly recommend this restaurant. Despite it being a really popular spot, we only waited 30 minutes for a table of 4 at noon. Our waiters were great at answering our questions. I ordered the chicken pot pie, which was delicious. Portions here are pretty big and definitely worth the price. I would come back when I'm in town again!"
Bini V.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1/4/2017,5.0,"Go the restaurant after having an appointment. If you don't have an appointment, there are places inside the restaurant where you can wait. Generally the wait will be just about 30 minutes. I tried three different sea foods - tuna salad, lobster mac and cheese and shrimp. The salad was very good. The mac and cheese came out to be so nice. I hoped if we had more lobster inside the dish as it is the most expensive dish available. Generally the service is good and you can have a long chat even after having a coffee. To sum up, it is a good place to hang out and have food."
Razi H.,"Fairfax, VA",4/21/2017,5.0,"Easily my favorite place in D.C. with the best breakfast/brunch in the area. Highly recommend the chicken and waffles or stuffed French toast (it looks like a Lincoln log house). Benedicts and cornbread are good and so is their coffee. You honestly can't go with anything on the menu. And for an all you can eat version, check out the Tysons location."
Mallory R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",4/14/2016,5.0,"SO DELICIOUS.I went here for dinner with some friends. We started with the beignets (because dessert first is always a good idea), which were amazing. I ordered the meatloaf, which was a little saltier than I would have liked (the waiter warned me, and I ignored him, so that's all on me). One of my friends ordered the pasta with ham, peas, and apples. She absolutely loved it (and let me try some and it was amazing). The atmosphere was great, too. We really enjoyed our meal."
Rachel M.,"Washington, DC",9/13/2015,5.0,"You should go here. Everything at Founding Farmers is good. There is nothing I wouldnt order, and I'll tell ya, I've had a lot of things on the menu.Summary (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars):Food: 5 starsDrinks: 5 starsAtmosphere: 5 starsService: 5 starsPrice: 4 starsFood: Founding Farmers is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, daily. What should you get? Here are the top 3 items I'd recommend for each meal:Breakfast:Stuffed french toast w/ strawberriesChicken & wafflesHangover hash. Lunch:Goat cheese burgerAhi tuna saladGrilled cheese (with ham) and tomato soupDinner:Plank salmonChicken pot pieChicken & waffles (which also comes with amazing mac & cheese)Oh, and you need to get appetizers and dessert too.Appetizers:Fried green tomatoesGarlic black peppers wingsSkillet cornbreadDesserts:Carrot Cake (comes with homemade ice cream)Red Velvet Cake (also comes with homemade ice cream)BeignetsDrinks: They have delicious cocktails. My favorite will always be The Basement (which was a strawberry whiskey smash, that is no longer listed). My top 3 on the menu:Fraise Fling (pretty pink drink with lychee (similar to strawberries), vodka, and proseccoLa Paloma (if you like tequila, great cocktail that's not too sweet)Darm n Stormy (classic, they do it well)Atmosphere: It's a lively place that is always busy. It's casual and approachable yet classy. Great for dinner with friends, a business meeting, or a date. Upstairs is a little bit quieter than downstairs if you want to be able to talk extensively. Service: All of the servers are knowledgeable and can tell you about the restaurant, their concept, the bar program, and the menu. My servers have always been attentive but not overbearing. Price: You can make it as expensive or inexpensive as you want. You can easily get an $11 entree if you're trying to keep costs lower, or you can add on an appetizer, nice cocktail, dessert if you choose. This is a great go-to for almost any occasion. There is something on the menu for everyone."
Kristin G.,"San Mateo, CA",10/19/2016,5.0,"Every time I have a guest from out of town this is where I head.  The food is stupid good.  I reluctantly ordered the Goat Cheese Ravioli with Chicken Cutlet, I'm not a huge pasta fan.  This was one of the best things I've EVER eaten.  The food there knocks my socks off EVERY TIME, unless I order a sandwich.  Their sandwiches aren't exciting.  :(  Lesson learned.Both their sodas and their cocktails are fun and interesting.  Love this place."
T M.,"Odenton, MD",7/31/2017,5.0,"We enjoyed our first visit to Founding Farmers so much that we took our family here for Thanksgiving dinner, when they visited over the holiday (we were unable to host them all in our 0ne bedroom apartment). The food and service are great and this place has become a favorite go-to when we're in D.C."
Dorene M.,"St Petersburg, FL",10/11/2015,4.0,"We ended up here based on a recommendation and of course I checked out the yelp reviews.We started off with fried green tomatoes and the bacon wrapped gorganzola stuffed dates. Both were very good.They have a great list of creative cocktails, so we both tried one. I wasn't a fan of mine, I was struggling to drink it and the server noticed and asked me about it. I told her I wasn't a fan but I was trying to drink. She was nice enough to say that I shouldn't have to try to drink and she would get me something different. After asking me what I liked, she came back with a different that I actually enjoyed.Now onto our entrees, I ordered the chicken and waffles.  They flavor was good but the skin on the chicken was not crisp. If you serve fried chicken, you have to serve crispy chicken. Bummed the chicken wasn't  crispy but on the positive side the chicken was moist. My dinning companion had the roasted chicken and loved it. She also ordered a side of cornbread that was served in a skillet, it was delish. Overall everything was really good from service, to decor and food. So the rating is really a 4.5 but couldn't give them 5 since the chicken wasn't crispy. Will definitely come back next time I'm in D.C."
Angelica P.,"Washington, DC",3/6/2017,5.0,Went here for Sunday brunch on a date.  It doesn't get any better than this ladies and gentlemen.  I ordered the chicken and waffles with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  A lot of carbs I know!!  I ate every bit of it.  The mimosas were on point to.  I ate brunch at another location and it just wasn't the same.  I have ate dinner here before in Maryland and it was great.  Brunch is what sticks out in my mind.
Doug W.,"San Francisco, CA",4/18/2017,4.0,"Reliable, if a little generic. But reliable! And you can go here for breakfast or lunch or dinner and get some very decent food."
Paige S.,"North Hollywood, CA",12/30/2016,4.0,"I visited Founding Farmers twice, and both times I ordered the corn bread as well as shrimp bucatini. Both were excellent! The cornbread goes perfectly with the salted honey butter--slathering it all over a slice of bread is the best feeling. But make sure to share between 4-6 people, because the bread comes in a skillet and is pretty large to share.The chicken and waffles, which my friend ordered, is the restaurant's most popular dish. I had a taste, and I love the mac n cheese that comes on the side and the crispiness of the waffle. It goes really well with the fried chicken, which my friend quickly ate all of.Other appetizers we ordered for the table: chicken wings and wedge salad. I'd say order the chicken wings but skip on the salad.The restaurant is pretty loud considering the number of people it houses, but the atmosphere is still nice in that the interior feels rustic and welcoming--a bit of southern charm thrown in. It takes a while to be seated if you walk in, so most definitely make a reservation before you go."
Jessica W.,"Durham, NC",9/6/2015,5.0,"This place really is as good as the reviews suggest. We went on a Sunday for brunch. Made a reservation for 1pm, and only had to wait maybe 10 minutes past our res time to get seated. The service was pretty good -- not exceptional, but no complaints either. The place is always packed and the servers are busy, but our server was attentive and friendly. For food, we started with the cornbread. AMAZING. Get the cornbread. For our entrees, I had the roasted veggie scrambler and the BF had the chicken and waffles. He inhaled his food before I had a chance to try it, but it looked delicious. My scrambler was fantastic. Full of veggies and topped with cheese, served with hash browns. The portions are big, but the food is all very fresh and well prepared, so I didn't feel overwhelmingly full when we left. Overall I'd definitely recommend this place. It's that good! Just make sure to make a reservation in advance -- otherwise you might be waiting all day for a table."
Glen H.,"Oakton, VA",10/7/2016,4.0,"Large portions, fresh healthy ingredients, a creative play on inspired comfort food."
Trevina R.,"Fairfax, VA",5/22/2017,5.0,"My fiance and I LOVE Founding Farmers. We've had at least 10 different items and have loved every meal. Their chicken and waffles are phenomenal, burgers are fantastic, and vegetarian options are delicious. This place is DC must for anyone visiting or local."
Timothy A.,"Alhambra, CA",2/15/2016,3.0,"Honestly, I was just underwhelmed by this place. Simple as that. I really wanted to like this spot after seeing all the great reviews and pictures, but the food just wasn't up to par. Came here with my family during a quick visit back home from the west coast, and I was really excited. The place was packed, but we had put in reservations so it was all good. We sat upstairs, and I ordered the chicken pot pie, which I was told was amazing. However, the pot pie was just meh, and I've honestly had much better pot pies from other places. To give a little credit, the cornbread they gave out was pretty good. All in all, a cool place with a cool, casual vibe going on. I just wouldn't come back if the rest of their food was similar to what we ate. The rest of my family was equally underwhelmed, but we had a good time just hanging out there."
Kevin A.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",12/28/2016,4.0,"Rustic-chic farm-to-table dining. Founding Farmers offers delicious modernized American comfort food at decent prices, with friendly staff and a quaint decor. (12/28/16)Food 5/5 | Atmosphere 4/5 | Service 3/5 | Value 4/5Pros: Amazingly delicious foodCons: Constantly busy staff can mean inattentive serviceTip: Definitely make a reservation. Wait times without one go upwards of an hour. ----Food 5/5I got the chicken and waffles and I have to say, it's the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. Crispy flavorful batter with a slight kick. Great creamy white sauce and the syrup tied everything in together. The scrambled eggs on the side were average. My friend had the Founding Farmers Breakfast with extra side. The chicken and apple sausage was great and the farmer's salad too. But the real winner was the Leek Hash. It was crispy but creamy and was perfectly seasoned to match with the savory and aromatic sausage. The scrambled eggs were a little overdone; I would suggest maybe getting fried eggs instead. Atmosphere 4/5Great decor; rustic but still catered to modern sensibilities. Good and clean space.Service 3/5They were quite busy so we got served a bit late, and the people who seated us, took our order, and gave us our checks were all different. Some continuity would have been nice. The server next to us was very friendly. Ours was less so. Value 4/5Overall the food is too good to not come again. Ranges around $10-$15."
Kevin K.,"Cupertino, CA",10/5/2016,4.0,"4 stars is pretty spot on. The service was really nice and efficient, the restaurant had a nice ambiance (definitely busy for a friday brunch). The food was really good. My wife had chicken and waffles and I had the shrimp and grits. Despite the chicken and waffles being really popular across Yelp, I def thought my shrimp and grits was the winner- cheesy, creamy, some acid from the tomatoes, a litlte heat from the andouille sausage etc..awesome. The cornbread was also really good and fresh. The one disappointment was the bacon lollies which tasted kinda like plain bacon with some cinnamon sugar- should be amazing but most were a little on the cold side and just didnt seem worth the ten bucks. Overall a good experience."
Nicole A.,"Glendale, WI",6/27/2016,4.0,"On the first day of our arrival in DC This restaurant 3 blocks from our hotel was recommended by the front desk staff as more ""fun"" than another closer spot he had recommended. Without a reservation, I had to wait with 2 hungry kids for over an hour after a full day of travel.But the food did not disappoint!! The simple waffle for my 6 year old was excellent and served with real maple syrup. My teenager's chicken and waffles and 2 sides was devoured to the last bite. My shrimp and grits was one of the best I ever had with giant shrimp and not overloaded with grits.We forgot to ask why the water was served tepid and we had to request ice?!?We would definitely return, with a reservation!"
Michelle F.,"Sandy, UT",7/20/2017,5.0,"It's all good. Just go. The cocktails are outstanding. Shrimp & grits are not the usual fare- slightly spicy & incredibly flavorful, you will want to lick the plate."
Al L.,"Vienna, VA",7/12/2017,5.0,"I went with my girlfriend to this place on a whim. The bread, crackers, and chips basket was amazing but the drinks were fantastic. Surprisingly well priced for the quality that the restaurant had to offer. The bartenders were prompt and super nice. We had a fantastic time!"
Bahman A.,"San Jose, CA",9/2/2016,1.0,"After waiting for about an hour to get a table my named called.Very cold in here. Came here from California and saw the good reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I saw everyone was rubbing their arms and body. Even i asked someone else how do you feel and he and his GF confirmed it's very cold in here. I have told the waitress and someone else but no change at all and our waitress only said she is sorry. Not her mistake though.Not acceptable. Did not enjoy the food. I think i got cold in here!!!Update: As I'm updating this review my wife and I are at the hotel in hour room soaking or feet into HOT water. I can feel the cold deep into my bones though the weather is pretty warm in DC.I'm not discouraging people to go, to be honest food is great but it's not all about food.Tip for first-timers: Make sure to bring your jacket or sweater even in summer."
Julianna K.,"Columbia, MO",8/8/2016,5.0,"WOW what a great place to dine! Great service and excellent menu. Highly recommend the skillet corn bread for an appetizer. I had the chicken and waffles because it's one of their most popular dishes and it a very good, HUGE portion. I also had red velvet cake for dessert which was a huge slice that was very delicious. I recommend making a reservation because the wait could be long! Overall, a very good place to dine in DC."
Jason V.,"Northampton, PA",4/10/2017,2.0,"Very bad with reservations.  They seated us 30 mins after our reservation.  We were all here at the time of reservation.  When we ordered they were out of French toast.  Half the menu was French toast, so that made it tricky to order something else.  It's fine, just annoying."
renje g.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/5/2016,5.0,"- There's not much more I can add that almost 8,000 people did not- All I can say, is make your resey, show up on time- If you come to brunch, come early, there's gonna be a line regardless"
Eric K.,Australia,2/6/2017,1.0,Booked for 8pm through OpenTable which was accepted. We arrived 5 mins early and were told they were running behind 10 or 15 mins. After 20 mins I asked how much longer we were going to have to wait and was told maybe 15 mins or so.    Why does the restaurant accept bookings if they cannot honour them? Obviously my time and my family's are of little importance.    We left and ate elsewhere.
Food L.,"Houston, TX",7/19/2017,5.0,Excellent food.  I had the Goat Cheese Ravioli and it was delicious.  Make sure that you secure reservations because the place is busy!!
Trish K.,"Woodbridge, VA",9/3/2016,4.0,"We only had breakfast and let's be honest- kinda hard to screw up breakfast. HIGHLY recommend a reservation. It was packed. I had the farmers breakfast. Nothing to write home about but I knew that when I ordered it. The grits threw me off. They looked like oatmeal!  Very good grits. Large grind. My mom had a cucumber vodka drink that was delicious!  Very strong coffee, which I love. Everyone else loved their chicken and waffles."

Updated review",3.0,"I don't know if Founding Farmers has just gone downhill due to its hype and popularity or what, but I was not impressed when I returned recently. The food was all average to sub-par and presentation was lacking. The service was exceptionally slow as well. The food we got for dinner was ok -- it was flavorful but left something to be desired. We orderd the deviled eggs for an app, and it was SO salty. Not only that but the egg halves were left semi empty - they didn't put enough of the deviled filling in each.  My friend got the steak and enchiladas for her entree -- the steak had a slightly bitter aftertaste. I got the salmon Meunière with the squash and mashed potato sides -- everything was soo oily and drenched in butter. It was so much butter that I was almost grossed out. (Yes I know Meunière sauce involves  butter but this was overkill). Even my veggies seemed drenched. We shared a cheesecake with fresh fruit compote for dessert and it was delicious, but a sort of small slice. I had remembered the desserts being HUGE at Founding Farmers before.  The food basically reminded me of an Outback or similar mid-range chain restaurant. Maybe it was an off-night but for the prices they charge, you can definitely find better in DC."
Kelley V.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",8/2/2017,3.0,Food was good.  Service was poor.  Food took a long time which is fine but we also waited forever for coffee and water.  Bummer since we waited so many days to eat here.
Adam M.,"Bartlett, IL",9/30/2016,5.0,"Run, don't walk to this place.  Breakfast was outstanding.  We ordered the bananas foster pancakes, sausage scramble and the beignets.  The bananas foster pancakes were maybe the best pancakes I've ever had.  And the beignets were really good too.  The scramble was solid.  Really, really good.  Love this place....likely going back there again on this trip.  Haven't tried the red velvet pancakes yet...."
Kate G.,"Washington, DC",4/2/2016,5.0,"Loved this restaurant! You have to make a reservation as the wait can be long, but the food is amazing. Nothing beats farm to table food. Everything tastes very fresh. The portions are very generous. I ordered the pot roast and the meat was so tender you didn't even need a knife. The mashed potato might be the best I've ever eaten. I also tried my friend's chicken pot pie, which was amazing! It's not a traditional chicken pot pie with a crust but it has a sweet cornbread topping - very yummy. I'd highly recommend this place for group dinners."
Nicole S.,"Union City, NJ",3/18/2017,3.0,"First things first, please don't ever wait 1+ hours for seating here. The food isn't terrible but it's not worth the hype either. I had a peach Bellini and a latte. The Bellini was very good and the latte was above average.The breakfast chicken and waffles were good as well but the waffle was a little soggy for my liking. The Benedict sausage and gravy tasted good but a a bit underwhelming. Both meals could have used more gravy.Overall, it's a decent place but considering it's always packed I don't think it's worth a long wait."
Mitchell M.,"Coral Springs, FL",4/8/2017,3.0,"Bustling place with a lot of energy and friendly service. Interesting menu primarily made up of comfort type. We ordered many dishes and shared amongst the table.Had Breads, Chips, and Crisps  which essentially was a combo of good bread, good potato chips and mediocre cheese type crisp which should be 86'ed.Had meatless cauliflower steak which was so-so.Had southern pan fried chicken with waffles and Mac. Chicken was good, Mac was so-so.Chicken bolognese was very good.Kentucky beef burgo stew was good but there was a spice that we all seemed to not be keen about.Their large mixed green salad with pulled chicken also was very good.Blue ribbon apple pie was good and red velvet cake was good to very good.For this type of food I would be back."
Patty B.,"Miami, FL",11/26/2016,5.0,Fried green tomatoes & corn bread were amazing! Best meal we had in DC. Highly recommend!!
Arthur Z.,"Irvine, CA",11/7/2016,5.0,"Excellent choice to come here the first time. And now it keeps happening. Absolutely love the food and decor. Decent cocktails. Food is delicious with ample servings. And wide array of options to choose from. Gets crowded so come early. Service is also not the best, and they can occasionally get too stressed to treat you right. Restrooms are very very limited, so the line to the restroom can be long even on a slow day. I still give it 5 stars cause I absolutely love the food and restaurant ambience."
Casandra W.,"Orange, CA",10/25/2016,5.0,Awesome breakfast. I had the farmers breakfast and we shared some of the French toast. Super fresh and well made. I can see why there is a wait here on the weekends and evenings.
Christine Y.,"Washington, DC",8/24/2016,2.0,This is a glorified cheesecake factory. Overpriced. Extremely overhyped. Always a chaotic mess inside because it's a huge tourist trap. Read the WaPo's 0 star review and don't waste your time here.
june k.,"Durham, NC",7/26/2015,3.0,"We came here with high expectations Bc we love the MOCO founding farmers. This location had lots more reviews so we were expecting it to be different, however I was a little disappointed.Moco's food is far better. We ordered our usual and their signature chicken and waffles.  Chicken and waffles were great and cooked and flavored to perfection, but the Mac and cheese was a bit undercooked and dry. MOCO always serves their Mac and cheese warm and fresh- noodles are always the perfect amount of chewy.  We got a side of cucumber/ snap peas.  It was served lukewarm and the cucumber was rather soggy.  I was hoping for a cool salad taste/texture.Our second dish was the scallops. The scallops were served on a bed of risotto. The flavor of the risotto was great, but was a bit undercooked- much like the Mac and cheese noodles.  There were 4 pieces of scallops.  Crispy and brown on the outside and chewy on the inside! Loved it but I did feel so gritty rocks with every bit of my scallops. Maybe they didn't clean it enough. Overall okay but prefer to eat at MOCO founding farmers."
Nate S.,"Monrovia, CA",4/13/2017,4.0,"Sat at the Bar. not a lot of room for eating and drinking, but full menu avaliable.  THAT CORN BREAD THO!!!!  with Honey Butter TOO!.  MUST HAVE!.  food was good tasting. made up for service quality.  Deviled eggs needs bacon."
Diana N.,"Dallas, TX",6/26/2015,4.0,"Locals recommended this place and we stopped in for lunch. We came a few minutes before they served lunch, which I highly recommend. The place was packed and there isn't much of a sitting area in the front. There are some great healthy/whole foods paperback books on display to pass time. If you can't get there early, make reservations beforehand. I really liked the modern, yet rustic feel of the place. Despite it being so crowded and loud for a week day lunch, the place seemed well organized. They had plenty of staff members tending to customers and our server was able to answer all of our questions about the menu and made great recommendations. The menu consists of amped up Americana cuisine. For appetizers, we orders the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Skillet Corn Bread. The Fried Green Tomatoes was good, but my favorite dish here was the cornbread. I must admit, that corn bread was the BEST I have ever had -- hands down! So moist with bits of corn kernels and that sea salted honey butter slathered on it was just like heaven in my mouth. =) For entrees, we had the Chicken and Waffles and the Yankee Pot Roast. The chicken was absolutely delicious. It was well-seasoned, not greasy, but still very tender. The waffles were good, but nothing spectacular. The pot roast was very tender and came out with a heaping portion of mashed potatoes. However, it was a tad bit salty, even for my taste.  Overall, our experience here was great! We really loved the restaurant and food, but most importantly, we liked how the place was so organized, despite the chaotic lunch crowd. Would definitely recommend."
T A.,"Washington, DC",10/8/2016,5.0,"Okay, so I tried their black velvet pancakes and I have to say it's like eating dark chocolate velvet cake for breakfast. The texture was light and perfect for breakfast. Absolutely amazing!"
Rachel M.,"Providence, RI",3/29/2016,5.0,"We were visiting my sister for Easter weekend, and she suggested this place. She also suggested getting reservations, which was a good idea. Even at 4:30, there was a crowd congregating in the entryway. We were seated right away, and our server arrived shortly thereafter. Perusing the menu, I had a tough time making a decision. So many things made my mouth water. I ended up getting the cauliflower steak, and you're probably thinking, ""Cauliflower steak? That made your mouth water?"" Okay, so I like cauliflower, and we'd been eating a lot of junk. I needed to clean my system with some veggies.But let me say, for getting a plate with just a huge piece of grilled cauliflower on it with some risotto, it was delicious! It wasn't doused in sauce, or cheese, but whatever they used to season it really brought out the flavor. It was tender, just the right amount of salt, and not overly filling. And since I was just getting cauliflower for dinner, I also ordered some appetizers.They have a selection of farm breads at the top of the menu, featuring different toppings. We had the one with brie and onion jam. Yum! I also got the fried green tomatoes with a crunchy outside and so juicy in the middle. They didn't have any children's items on the menu, but when we asked, they offered us a few selections. We also ordered the beignets for dessert which came with three different dipping sauces. Those, though, were a little greasy. Evenso, I would definitely come back next time we visit."
Chris C.,"San Diego, CA",4/12/2017,5.0,"Wow...just wow. I had the bleu cheese bacon burger that was phe-nom-e-nal. The deviled eggs were a bit late in arriving, but worth the wait. And the red velvet cake...so good. Definitely a great recommend, both for the outstanding service and to the chef!"
Suzan N.,"Fontana, CA",8/16/2016,2.0,"Good food, but terrible service. My server didn't seem like he cared too much to take care of my guest and I. I truly hope anyone who visits gets taken care of way better than I did. Wish I could have enjoyed my experience more, but I probably will never visit this place again.Also, if you ever get offered to sit at the long wooden table with stool seats that is next to the bar, I recommend you wait for the next available table.  The seats are way too uncomfortable and it'll keep you from enjoying your meal."
Eric J.,"North Bethesda, MD",4/9/2016,3.0,"The Spicy Ahi Tuna Poke was pretty good. It came in a bowl larger than I had expected.Drinks here are okay, and after three or four the delicacy of your taste buds run away for fun"
Courtney W.,"Washington, DC",2/6/2016,4.0,"Really great spot! They're always busy so we made reservation for dinner around 6pm. The menu is quite large so be prepared to navigate your way through that. There's so many options it's difficult to make a decision! The drinks are phenomenal  though, highly recommend taking the advice of your server or bartender!"
Jami C.,"North Haven, CT",4/11/2017,5.0,This is a great place for down home American food with a creative twist!  I had the pot pie with the most excellent pastry crust! My husband had the crab cakes with twice mashed red potatoes and an amazingly succulent ear of grilled corn smothered in a rich blanket of butter. My son had the cheeseburger with crispy fries.It was busy but well worth the wait. Staff and waiters are super friendly.
Samantha C.,Bay Area,8/7/2015,4.0,"Their skillet cornbread is probably the best cornbread I've had.  It's moist and sweet, with lots of kernels throughout.  It goes really well with the honey and butter.  Fried green tomatoes are also delicious.  Super crispy, but not oily.  Kettle popcorn is also good especially since it's served pipping hot.  The smell itself is very intoxicating. Chicken pot pie is good but the biscuit that comes with it is amazing.  It was big and dense and it complements the dish really well.  Shrimp and grits is also tasty, but a bit watery.  Food is a bit on the heavy side, but well worth the indulgence.  Portions are also quite generous. The place is noisy and kinda cramp.  Servers are nice but their so busy that it's hard to get their attention.  Reservations are highly recommended."
Nate A.,"Columbia, SC",12/15/2016,5.0,The beet and goat cheese hash was the best breakfast I've had in a long time! Excellent service and a great vibe
Jonathan D.,"Beverly, MA",6/25/2017,4.0,A huge brunch menu makes this an easy choice for a big group.  The cocktail list is imposing so leave yourself time or better yet check it out in advance. I had the Hangover Hash and it was fantastic.
Syleste M.,"Toano, VA",9/2/2016,4.0,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and for a Friday am we only had a 10 min wait. Mimosas are full of champagne instead of over kill on the OJ. I had the traditional Eggs Benedict and for this I give them the 4 stars. It was the best hollandaise sauce but you only get a tiny bit to put on both your eggs. If they served it already on with a bit more I would have given them 5 stars. The leek hash browns are a great compliment to this breakfast. My husband had the chicken and waffles suggested by the waitress and he was very happy. The syrup on the table has a cinnamon stick in it which we loved but beware of your not a fan."
Betty C.,"Wellesley Hills, MA",7/16/2017,2.0,"I must be missing something.  Yelp seldom let's me down but this place doesn't live up to the hype.  Beignets are always a treat and the chocolate was fudge not syrup so will give them credit for that.  Eggs were underdone (so much for that warning on the menu), ham had some strange congealed topping, maple black bacon way overdone and my English muffin wasn't even toasted.  There must be good bfast spots in DC but this isn't one of them!"
Carolyn M.,"Washington, DC",10/31/2016,3.0,"This place is very hit or miss.  The most recent time, we were told there was a 45 min wait - why is there always such a long wait there?! We ended up snagging a seat at the bar after 10 minutes.  The bartender was disinterested in us, and our food took at least 30 minutes to come out.  We asked him numerous times where it was, he said the manager was checking on it and we still heard nothing.  When we finally got our food he made some excuse about the kitchen being so busy close to the end of brunch time, yet everyone around us got theirs.The prices are very fair for such a trendy place so will give them that.  I got the bourbon french toast and it was overly oily and sweet and I could only have one piece.  Made me feel a little sick.  The tea was good though - coconut green tea - very smooth.  Hopefully this was just a bad experience.  It does bother me that even when you make a reservation at FFs they make you wait a while for a table, but I've had very good drinks there before so will give it some time and go back maybe in 6 months."
Bradley F.,"Vestavia Hills, AL",5/1/2017,5.0,Being from Alabama I can say that Founding Farmers does southern food right. It was awesome. I recommend the salt crusted prime rib and pesto bread.
Jeff S.,"Fort Myers, FL",7/25/2017,4.0,This was a great place with great atmosphere. Our waitress was wonderful. The only downside is the vodka was not great. Food was excellent.
Tra H.,"Arlington, VA",10/17/2016,3.0,"Yes, Founding Farmers' food is amazing. There is no doubt about that. I've eaten here multiple times and there was only one dish that I didn't like. But I cannot give them 5 stars or even 4. Why? They have ALWAYS run behind on all of their reservations. For a restaurant that almost never takes walk-ins, their timing even on reservations is awful. I have never had to wait less than 30 to get to my table, no matter what time my reservation is. Made a reservation at 8:30? Yeah you're not eating until at least 9:15, sucker. Good luck not starving!But once you sit down, I highly recommend their popcorn as appetizer and the gnocchi with sausage and thai basil as entree.  Amazing! :-)"
Anjani V.,"Manhattan, NY",10/8/2016,4.0,"The waffles were light and airy - recommend Prices were awesome for the quality of foodHowever, this place is WAAAY too overhyped for what it is - a slightly above average brunch place with decent food. No idea why it's so hard to get reservations here."
Kim K.,"Chesapeake, VA",9/7/2016,3.0,"Truly an very eclectic menu and something for everyone. We had reservations but they still tried to stick us in a non reservation area. I tried the butternut squash pasta and it was very tasty, just a very small portion. However, the dessert, which claims to serve two, was enough to feed at least 4 people. I think another time would just get dessert and a coffee."
L R.,"Washington, DC",7/24/2017,5.0,"Fabulous, creative food. Scratch sodas are wonderful, as are the cocktails. I have not tried anything that wasn't absolutely delectable."
Mikayla T.,"Orange, CT",4/30/2017,5.0,"A wonderful brunch for a large group! They were able to accommodate all of my requests, including seating us in a private area and allowing the hosts time to set up. We all shared the whipped blueberry butter pancakes, fresh strawberries & cream stuffed French toast & Founding Farmers breakfast. Bellini & mimosas were great. Everyone was friendly even on a very busy Sunday."
Nevada J.,"Alexandria, VA",4/9/2017,4.0,"This joint was paaacked for Sunday brunch. We arrived be early without a reservation.  They squeezed us in,  barely. The place was nice,  clean and busy.  The wait staff was kind and very knowledgeable. They are really health conscious.   The food was awesome.  I would go again.  Highly recommend."
Russo J.,"Metairie, LA",3/7/2017,5.0,"Found this gem with a little Yelp Help.  It was awesome all around excellent!  Cocktails at the bar, food and service.  I also believe it is very fairly priced for the quality provided.  We did wait a little while, 30 min or so, but I think that is to be expected at a great restaurant without reservations!"
Annie L.,"Cerritos, CA",3/22/2016,5.0,"I came with a party of 15 or so. As crowded as this place can get, they were kind enough to set aside a long table near the front of the restaurant. I can see why people emphasize making reservations. Food (5/5): For appetizers, I got the cornbread. It isn't my favorite kind of cornbread taste and texture but it's tasty. I liked the actual corn kernels inside. For my entree, I got the rotisserie chicken with mac 'n cheese and escabeche salad crop list sides. It seemed like half the rest of the table got their chicken and waffles. Their servings are really big so even though it is a little expensive, it should last you two normal sized meals or at least one humongous waist popping meal. I kept my fingers crossed that my rotisserie chicken would come out juicy and my wish came true. It was so tasty. All it needed was a squeeze of lemon (comes on the plate) to really bring out the flavors. I thought I would borrow some of my friends' gravy, but I did not end up needing it. The mac 'n cheese is solid. I didn't get any drinks but they all looked tasty and my friends ordered a few so it's a safe bet to say they are good.Service (5/5): The escabeche salad was not my flavor. One of my friends with more guts than I do talked to our server about it, and he immediately offered to bring another side for me. I was embarrassed because I normally don't send food back. But I was so glad that I got the sweet potatoes instead hehe.  They are so good. Really made the meal complete - so thank you Founding Farmers team!"
Courtney K.,"Annapolis, MD",9/19/2015,4.0,"Bottom Line:  A cool place with great food but service is slow.I really like Founding Farmers and I think George Washington would approve too.  The farm to table menu, as cliche as it may be these days, is delicious.  While I don't think you can go wrong here with any menu selections I highly recommend the chicken and waffles.  Also fabulous here are the fresh cocktails, albeit small pours. The desserts looked amazing although I did not get a chance to sink my sweet tooth into one of them. The restaurant is comfy and atheistically pleasing which is good since there is a lot of waiting around that goes on here.  Waiting for a table 15 to 20 minutes despite reservations, waiting for a server to greet us, waiting 20 minutes for drinks to come out, etc. I'm a patient person but wasn't prepared for the slow pace but next time I will be. If you are planning to visit Founding Farmers before another obligation then allow plenty of time to enjoy all that is offered at this delightful Foggy Bottom restaurant.The advertised ""smart casual"" dress code is confusing here but what it basically means is you can wear anything.  On my first visit here we were touring the museums so we wore shorts and shirts with fab accessories like scarves and sheer komono-ish tops to dress up our street attire.  But, if I was going into DC just for dinner I would wear something more along the lines of business casual.Overall a nice experience and I look forward to going back soon."
Heather S.,"Brooklyn, NY",2/11/2016,5.0,This place is definitely living up the hype. I went for brunch and it was great. I had a very friendly and kind server. I think his name was Ethan? I ordered the chai to keep me warm and had the chicken and waffles with eggs. The waffle was beyond delicious and the chicken tasted great with the gravy. I forced myself to try the red velvet and I say forced because I was so full but I really wanted to see what the hype is. It was ok. Not the best but not horrible. I wouldn't ordered it again. I loved it there
Hazel C.,"Washington, DC",10/27/2016,4.0,"Founding farmers has delicious food with heavy portions. I dined here yesterday for lunch and had the chicken and waffles with roasted potatoes and green beans. Waffles are on the crispy side but stillgood. The chicken is fried to perfection! The skillet cornbread is heavenly! Definitely worth the wait. You always want to make reservations. Be advised, with reservations, they will only seat you once the entire party is there."
Stephen A.,"Phoenix, AZ",7/26/2015,4.0,"What turned out to be a short layover on the way to NC, became a prolonged wait due to inclement weather. I tried airport food, which wasn't very comforting on a rainy day. So, I looked up any restaurant that wasn't far away. It's been awhile since I have been through DC, but I did remember visiting this place awhile back ago. I made reservations (highly encouraged as you will have a long wait) far enough in advance for me to hail a cab, and fight traffic in the rain.Once I arrived, the place was completely packed. Thank God for reservations. I wasn't that hungry, but I did want to try a small meal, with enough room enough left over for what I recall was a delicious skillet of cornbread. I didn't want to wait that long either as it took awhile to get here. Therefore, I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, and a whole skillet of warm cornbread. Perfect comfort food for an otherwise dismal day.The grilled cheese sandwich was okay. But, the cornbread was heavenly! And with it raining like cats and dogs outside, it was a nice place to hangout for several hours and just people watch.Now, I know why I remembered this place from my previous travels.Just a wonderful, if albeit crowded and noisy place even in the middle of the afternoon."
January B.,"Washington, DC",3/4/2017,5.0,"On Friday, March 3, we decided to set up a last-minute dinner reservations at the DC Founding Farmers.  We arrived on time, but our table was still not ready.  Upon arriving, we were made aware of the delay, and patiently sat in the waiting area.  We waited over an hour for our table to be ready, and that was okay because of the actions of the staff.  Everyone from the hostess to Guest Manager, Alex, repeatedly apologized and kept us updated on the status of our table.  They couldn't control that our reserved table was occupied by customers for much longer than they anticipated, however, they could manage our expectations.  Alex apologized, explained the situation, and let us know that because of our wait, we were the top priority of everyone at that restaurant.  Because my entire party has an extensive, high-level customer service background, his approach impressed us all.From the time we were seated at the table to the time that we walked out of the restaurant, the customer service was first class.  From, Duayne, our server to the different people who delivered food to our table, every staff member gave us top-notch service - it was friendly, it was fast, and ALL of the food was FANTASTIC.  Every appetizer, every main course, every side, every dessert, and even the drinks were MAGNIFICENT.  Duayne was very helpful, personable, and very attentive without being overbearing.  For example, right before we left, our food was packed up and not yet in the bag that he provided for us.  As Duayne was walking by our table, he picked up our containers and bagged them without being prompted, then kept going.  It happened so quickly that we were stunned.  Our experience with Duayne explains why we happily gave him a 30% tip, and we wished that we could have tipped Alex, the Guest Manager, as well.Alex is a very good example of the right person in the right job.  After we were seated, Alex came to our table in response to an issue someone in our party had with the temperature.  He apologized, took responsibility, and gave us multiple options to rectify the situation.  At the end of the meal, Alex returned to our table to again check on us.  As the cherry on top of our amazing dining experience, he even offered us complimentary desserts for our ""inconvenience"".  On our way out, he engaged with us again encouraging us to visit other locations to experience the variations of their menus.  Once again, as customer service experts, we were enthralled with how he interacted with us without ignoring other patrons while acknowledging and commending his staff.Ironically, the reason our table wasn't ready was because the party before us had been sitting there for over two hours eating and drinking and having a good time.  WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY IT TOOK THEM SO LONG. The service and food -- everything about this location makes you want to stay.  We were also at our table for over two hours without even realizing it.  Furthermore, we never had an opportunity to feel inconvenienced.  We didn't realize that we were waiting for a long time, and if we were, the wait was well worth it.  We are definitely coming back and bringing everyone we know to see Duayne and Alex and the rest of the great staff at Founding Farmers DC."
Cynthia M.,"Henderson, NV",1/5/2017,5.0,"Fantastic! Nice staff, energetic atmosohere, and the food! Oh, so good! Chicken and waffels, yum. Corn bread, yum. Fresh margaritas, yum. No room for dessert, darn. Make reservations and go!"
Madison M.,"Smyrna, TN",1/5/2017,4.0,"Amazing food. Our waiter seemed very busy and only checked on us once so I ran out of my drink and he never offered to refill it. Other than that, I would recommend this place for sure. Shrimp & Sun Dried Tomato Bucatini was sooo good."
Rick S.,"Washington, DC",9/16/2015,4.0,"I have no real complaints about Founding Farmers. Went with friends for brunch recently and had an enjoyable meal. The bananas foster stuffed french toast was masterfully prepared. Three french toast 'sticks' were sufficient for a meal (and I was hungry, though I got a side of the apple chicken sausage). A missed star because the benefits of being a 'farm to table' restaurant are a bit lost at breakfast I feel, where there are few vegetable options to choose from. My friends mushroom hash had mushrooms and some spinach, but as seen in the photo, it's mainly a dish full of bland yellow. To comment on the service, the waitress was excellent. I ordered the Farmers tea, thinking it was a hot tea (it's not). Our server replaced it with a delicious Earl Gray White tea with no questions asked, at no additional charge. I'll come back (but probably for dinner, not breakfast)."
Elissa R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",10/3/2016,5.0,"This place was great, very trendy and fun atmosphere. Went here for brunch, highly recommend the beignets! The chicken and waffles were really good too. Make a reservation or you will probably be looking at a long wait!"
Kristina M.,"Waldorf, MD",7/27/2016,1.0,"I used to frequent this establishment for lunch however my recent experience has changed my mind.  I arrived to the location around 2:15p which is after the lunch rush so I chose not to make a reservation.  When I arrived, the manager on duty (Caucasian lady with blond hair) asked me if I would be finished my lunch within an hour as she had a reservation coming in.  I looked at her and then I looked around the restaurant (half the tables were open) and I asked her was she rushing me through my meal.  She had a bizarre look on her face and responded that 1 hour was more than enough time to finish my meal.  I never answered her question but did tell her that I was dissatisfied with her question and that if I am to be rushed to finish a meal that I would leave.  She said no I can just place you at another table. After I was seated the service was great!  I absolutely loved my waiter.  At the end of my meal I asked to speak to a manager.  To my disbelief the same lady came over to me.  When I expressed to her how I felt as a customer, she told me that she always asks her customers this question.  (I have been here many times and was never asked this question) She then proceeds to tell me that they are always busy and they want to make sure that all customers have the time to eat.  I again, looked around the restaurant and said, most of your tables are open......you only have about 10 customers.  She proceeded to tell me she had a lot of customers canceled because they didn't have a patio so I was lucky to have a place to finish my meal.This type of response from a manager is completely unacceptable. I refuse to frequent a place that does not value all their customers."
Siu C.,"Tenafly, NJ",8/29/2016,5.0,"This place is very popular.  Must make reservations.  We got 2:45 reservations for Saturday lunch and after checkin, we were seated about 5-10 minutes later but saw tons of people all waiting.  We sat upstairs in a booth.  We had the bacon lollis, which were amazing.  Bacon skewers that tasted like fresh jerky and so yummy.  Chicken and waffles is their signature dish.  Comes with Mac and cheese and another side of your choice.  Generous portion, nice, crispy chicken.  The crispy shrimp came with 8 jumbo shrimp, Cole slaw, fries and cornbread.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  An hour later we were so stuffed that we had no room for dessert.  Definitely worth a stop."
Liz C.,"Odenton, MD",5/11/2017,3.0,"I love the food at this place, chicken and waffles is solid. But it was so unbearably loud and our waiter was so aloof and never came back to check on the table. It took forever for them to bring our bill and we had such issues getting refills on drinks. And we had to wait over an hour to get a table to start with. If you guys wanna pack the place full on a Friday, please have more staff to help."
Emma B.,"Leawood South, Leawood, KS",7/22/2017,5.0,"This was one of the best dinners I've had in ages!! I'm here visiting from out of town, and a local brought me. I had the rotisserie chicken, and if was incredible. Perfectly seasoned potatoes, juicy and flavorful chicken, and light green beans. My cousin had the fried chicken and waffles. The waffle is light and a little low on flavor, but the chicken is cooked to perfection. We finished our meal with the best apple pie I've ever had, with light vanilla ice cream on the side. It was a perfect night, and very affordable for the high quality of the product. For the size of the restaurant our service was perfect and everything came out efficiently and correctly prepared. 10/10 recommend!"
Alexis K.,"Washington, DC",5/26/2015,4.0,"After walking around DC all afternoon, Will C. and I were starving. We walked into Founding Farmers at around 5:50pm without reservations (poor planning on our part), and had to wait about an hour or so for tables. So...as pretty much every Yelper has said in their reviews...MAKE RESERVATIONS. My first Founding Farmers experience was at the Mclean location and I would describe that experience as being just so-so. However, the DC location really delivered - the food was excellent and service was good.We decided to skip appetizers that night as the portion sizes are enormous. He got the Pot Roast and I got the Chicken & Waffles. The Chicken & Waffles comes with two huge (I mean, HUGE) bone-in pieces of chicken, 1/2 a waffle, mac & cheese, some country style gravy, and a side of your choice (I went with the Mint Watermelon). The chicken was perrrrrrrfect. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and I love that the chicken was bone-in. The mac & cheese was creamy and delicious as well. Pretty much, everythiing about my dish was solid. I had a bite or two of my boyfriend's Pot Roast, and I thought it was absolutely delicious - super flavorful, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. We were both very satisfied with our meal and left feeling completely stuffed. It was difficult walking back to the car, at least for me anyways. Needless to say, Will C. and I will be back for more. That fried chicken is bombbb."
Amanda W.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",9/12/2015,4.0,"Fresh tasting food. I enjoyed the experience here. The seafood deviled eggs were a little pricey, and probably not worth to get again, but I am glad I tried them (they are one of my favorite appetizer kinda foods). The fried green tomatoes were tasty. I am not a tomato fan, but I definitely ate my portion out of them - not too much breading, which is enjoyable. Farmhouse platter (baby cheeseburgers, chili dog, pork ribs, potato salad, corn) - Baby cheeseburgers were delicious! As was the chili dog. The pork ribs were fall off the bone practically. The potato salad I could have done without, and the corn was very well prepared, but it is just corn (in my opinion). RED VELVET CAKE = loveI need to come back for breakfast!"
Virginia C.,"Silver Spring, MD",4/27/2017,5.0,"Food was EXCELLENT. My husband accidentally left his credit card there. Called them the next day and they had it, no problem. Can't wait to go back."
Justin H.,"Ocean Springs, MS",4/6/2017,4.0,"This place is definitely popular and was packed when we arrived.  Expect a wait to be seated but the bar is first come, first served.  While we waited, we sampled a couple of drinks.  I can't say that we were fans of the drinks.  My wife had the The Clementine, which was described as having a spicy flavor but it was beyond spicy and tough to drink.  A side note on that is that we are huge fans of spicy seasonings and cajun flavors.  It was just over the top.  I tried the improved Mai Tai and I felt that the bitters overpowered the drink's flavor.  We were offered to sit family style at a long table to avoid the full 1 1/2 hour wait so we obliged and it was a pleasant seating arrangement.   We ordered the fried green tomato for an appetizer and while good, weren't the best I've had.  My wife ordered the short ribs and I had the prime rib, both were flavorful and quickly delivered.  We had to try the red velvet cake for desert.... delicious and a huge portion definitely meant to be shared.  Service was great from hostess to bartender to server.  Overall, we both were pleased with the food and experience."
Deb M.,"Santa Ana, CA",5/10/2017,5.0,"I enjoyed everything about the food & the service at Founding Farmers. Mario, our waiter, was friendly, helpful & efficient. The fried green tomatoes were delicious. Fresh, grilled asparagus was wonderful. My prime rib sandwich was nearly the best sandwich I've ever eaten. The bread was fabulous & fresh. I tasted the carrot cake, too! Great! I was glad I made a reservation, even for a Monday night! Very popular place."
Albert P.,"Miami, FL",12/31/2016,5.0,"Delicious, nice ambience.  Awesome hash brown's,. Stuffed French toast with strawberries delicious. If you don't want to wait make reservations. If not it will be a long way time. We really enjoyed the food  Had the steak and eggs, great taste on the steak and tender"
Justin V.,"Chicago, IL",1/22/2016,4.0,"We went to Founding Farmers on the day of New Years Eve. The restaurant was completely packed, and we were determined to try this place based on the strong referrals we received.  We had to wait for an hour before being seated. Fortunately, there was a nice coffee shop around the corner so we passed the time there waiting for our table. The decor inside the restaurant is bright and lively. It's cozy inside and patrons are seated closely together. Our server was delightful, but she was not consistently attentive. I don't fault her for that, though. It was exceptionally busy (and it was also a holiday) and she was still able to maintain a pleasant demeanor while sprinting around the restaurant, clearly overworked.While looking at the menu, the chicken and waffles jumped out at me. The waffles were fluffy and the syrup was sweet and delicious. The dish included two full pieces of chicken instead of chicken tenders! The dish included mac and cheese and potato chips as my two sides. The chips were fresh, crispy, and well-flavored. My fiance ordered the Farmhouse Platter, so I had the opportunity to sample a bit of everything. The platter included baby cheeseburgers, a chili dog, pork ribs, potato salad, and corn. The wait can take quite a long time and the restaurant is typically packed to the point where service can lag. However, I would say the food is good enough to wait it out!"
Anna T.,"Arlington, VA",7/1/2016,5.0,"Last night (Thursday summer night) was date night for me and my bf and we chose to revisit FF! we made a reservation for 8 and got there about 7:40 and got seated 7:50. I ordered the fried chicken salad and the chicken was so tender and juicy there was a good amount of avocado and bacon in there as well (my favorites). It had a honey mustard dressing which went perfectly with the salad.This was me and my boyfriend's second time at FF DC and it did not disappoint. We also got the beignets this time and they were SO light, fluffy and melt in your mouth good. Our server, Nelson, was attentive and perfectly nice. Fair prices for what we ordered as well. Oh! and lastly, the vanilla scratch soda. Very sweet (which I was a fan of, but could see it being too sweet for others) so I didn't need a refill. Overall good experience and would definitely go again."
Cindy L.,"Cleveland, OH",12/30/2016,3.0,"This place did not quite live up to the hype. The service was quite slow, and it was difficult to get a server's attention. Perhaps it was also because we were seated at a corner. The food definitely was good, I must say. The cornbread is also definitely DEFINITELY a must. If you don't mind a super bustling atmosphere, this place is quite good!"
Sophia T.,"Arlington, VA",2/8/2016,4.0,"Brunch Buffets are probably one of the best things to ever grace our great city. Founding Farmers does a pretty good job as their food was excellent overall. I enjoyed most everything, and I felt satisfied by just a few bites of each dish. To me this means that the food is tasty, light, but filling - in other words, it isn't pure junk food. The service was also great, a very friendly waitstaff, and our waitress was a sweet girl, I think her name was Caitlin, who was on top of everything the whole time. As a coffee snob, I also recommend their coffee. They get it from a company called Global, and it is a farmer's blend 'exclusively' for Founding Farmers. I really enjoyed it. The one thing I don't like about their service is that they walk around with items to offer you. It is impossible to get to everyone as they frequently run out. They say that the waiters make rounds every 10 minutes or so, but we were there for 45 minutes and each thing came around 1x, with the exception of the shrimp in which we had to ask or we would have never gotten any. I also think that the eggs Benedict should not be on rounds as well, but made to order, as it was cold by the time it got to our table. It would have tasted better hot. :/ We really enjoyed our experience though! Good eatin'!"
Brian K.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",7/4/2017,3.0,"I actually have 3 ratings for our visit, staff, food, and management.    First the staff, 1 star.  We sat at the bar and the bartender seemed from the start that he didn't want to be there and felt even less about us being there.  Towards the end of the meal another bartender got was arguing with a waitress who was asking about a drink order and he yelled at her that it was on the bar waiting.    A little communication is fine but he was just yelling about being busy making drinks and then her order was sitting over there.   Next up the food.    Deviled eggs were ok but nothing to write home about, the trio of farmers hotdogs were tasty and I'd have given them a 4 but then the meatloaf while huge, was kinda cold.   The side of Mac and cheese was completely forgotten and had to be reordered.  The biggest issue, 49 min from when we ordered our food arrived.   Our bartender comped our deviled eggs for us but then was gone and the check was unaltered.    Now on to management, they get a five because I can't give them a six.   The manager come by, unrequested, apologizes about everything and comps the entire meal.   The is manager so the issue and did the right thing without request and gave us his card and said he wants to make sure we come back so they can do the job he knows they can do.    Overall the 3 is the average of all 3 experiences."
Dee L.,"Durham, NC",3/13/2016,4.0,"Have been here 3 times and have loved it each time. Ambience: Awesome ambience, super trendy and cool but comfortable and relaxed as well. Medium noise so good for date night or group dinner.Food: Everything here is unique and yummy. Deviled eggs are corn bread are great apps. The Yankee pot roast is flavorful and juicy. The chicken pot pie is a little different than usual but delicious. Chicken and waffles are great - big portion and great flavor combo. My favorite is the shrimp and grits - so many delicious flavors together!!! It's also surprisingly affordable - most meals for around $15-$20. Service: Get a reservation. One time we didn't have one and waited LEGIT 2 hours. It was worth it but ugh. The hostesses can be overwhelmed and short but the servers are always super friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. Can't wait til my next Farmers experience!"
Susan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/4/2015,3.0,"I've never seen an establishment with more Yelp reviews!Founding Farmers is VERY popular.  We ate at 6pm and the restaurant was packed with groups of people waiting outside.  Definitely get a reservation before coming.  They're very organized and if you booked a table, they will most certainly honor it despite how many walk-ins might be waiting.The menu is very American/Southern. There were lots of tempting choices (i.e., chicken and waffles... got a weakness for it) and few ""healthy"" choices.  Everything looks pretty hearty and heavy.We started with an order of fried green tomatoes ($8) because I've never had it before. The breading was a little too thick and hard for my taste but I don't know if it's meant to be that way.  The tomato slice are indeed green and tangy! The order came with a green sauce and a goat cheese sauce.We ordered a 14 oz. prime rib (medium) with green beans with candied lemon and the potato salad with pickled vegetables. For $28, it was quite the deal because the portions were massive. The prime rib was OK in flavor. It came with a side of gravy and horseradish sauce. The green beans and potato salad weren't that good. They had pickled cauliflower in the potato salad which gave the whole side a kind of stinkiness.We also had the seafood bucatini which my stomach was intimidated by because it was so big. The seafood included lots of mussels, half a lobster tail, a few shrimp and a piece of fried cod (think fish and chips). It was all very fresh. The sauce had diced tomatoes and a buttery-rich finish. The pasta was good but almost too much. It was al dente but it kind of clung to the bottom of the cast-iron platter. All-in-all, a great deal at $29 for this massive serving of fresh seafood. It also had two large pieces of grilled bread -- who can eat all that food?Note to self -- order the fish and chips next time.  The fried cod in my seafood bucatini was AMAZING."
Saman J.,"Brampton, Canada",7/4/2017,5.0,"Great food, great ambiance, great service. The atmosphere is lively and hip, drinks are freshly made, lots of options for all dietary needs. The rotisserie chicken is very flavorful and fresh tasting, portions are very good, prices are reasonable."
Brandon M.,"Foggy Bottom, Washington, DC",5/9/2017,3.0,"It's a DC institution, but really focused more on tourists and not regulars. The food and drink are good, but not amazing. They are routinely late with your reservation and always packed, which makes it hard to go if you live around it."
Alexandra M.,"Sherborn, MA",5/9/2017,3.0,"I heard great things about this restaurant and made it a goal of mine to eat there before I left D.C.  My Dad came to visit me and I booked a reservation here for us because I figured it was a great place to go.  We were seated almost right away, which was great.  Our waiters were very nice.  Food was okay, nothing out of this world.  We looked at the receipt and noticed that the price was a little high.  I had ordered the steak which comes with a choice of two ""crop list sides"".  I ordered the green beans and potatoes.  When we got the receipt, we had been charged two extra dollars for the sides because the waiter had put down the wrong ones.  But by the time I noticed we had already paid.  That's the bummer of the night.  We ordered the cookies for dessert-would not recommend.  They are very small and really hard.  Not good."
Zakiya P.,"Farmington Hills, MI",8/12/2016,4.0,"Went to Founding Farmers on three separate occasions during a recent visit. Loved coming here for lunch and dinner! The waiters were definitely knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant as well as the menu. I loved all of their recommendations! The corn bread as an appetizer was to die for! It was perfectly moist and the butter complemented it perfectly (I believe it was a sea salt spread). I ended up getting the steak with chicken enchiladas and street corn. The steak was divine, probably the best I've ever had. The enchiladas were good but I've had much better street corn. It tasted a little overcooked and hard, with no flavor. I paired a Mai tai drink with my dinner which was amazing; probably my favorite of all time. My boyfriend got the pot roast and had no complaints. The apple pie for dessert was awesome. I will say that the vanilla bean ice cream was nothing special. I've probably had better in the grocery store.I also went for lunch one day and got the fried chicken salad. They definitely give you good portions of chicken and it was perfectly cooked. They also have nice bacon pieces that complements the salad nicely. The only thing that was an unpleasant surprise at first was the sweetness of the dressing. After a few bites this wasn't an issue.For breakfast, I will say that they seemed to put their newer wait staff on this shift (which most restaurants probably do). Our waiter didn't seem as knowledgable as the other two I had experienced previously. He didn't take the time to explain menu items, such as the French toast being extremely tough because it was deep fried (think Burger King but with out the soft core). The pancakes were amazing though! The batter used to make them was so rich but not overly sweet. You didn't need to use much syrup because the pancakes were that good on their own. The syrup is infused with a cinnamon stick placed inside the syrup container. The bacon was excellent and very smoky. Also, the leek hash browns were fabulous. I normally use lots of ketchup but they don't need any. The eggs weren't anything to write home about. Not bad, but nothing special. I also enjoyed the mimosa. More alcohol than orange juice, but overall still great."
Michelle H.,"Miami, FL",3/28/2017,5.0,"This place was highly recommended as a ""MUST"" for us to eat at while visiting D.C. by our good friends...we are so glad we listened! Amazingly yummy from beginning to end! The chicken & waffles were spectacularly tasty & surprisingly light. The crab benedict was super yummy. We were definitely wishing we had more room to try more of the tempting menu items...oh well, one more reason to return to D.C.!"
Monica K.,"Arlington, VA",5/8/2017,3.0,"I enjoy coming to this place, although it is always busy so the staff are always busy and can't give you very much time. Their food is consistantly good and I wouldn't say I've ever had a bad meal here, but I wouldn't say their food is to die for. It is a nice place to have a brunch with friends or just a casual meal. I would recommend having a reservation, especially on the weekend as you can wait in line for over an hour without a reservation. I would definitely not say no to coming here for a meal and have always enjoyed my time here and would recommend it to others as there is something on the menu for everyone and they have the farm to table mentality, which I really love."

Joe P.,"Charlotte, NC",3/10/2016,5.0,"America needs more restaurants like D.C.'s Founding Farmers. It's trendy but not snobby, cool but inviting, and innovative without seeming too clever. And it serves just about the tastiest kettle popcorn I've ever had.On a recent visit with a group of colleagues, I fell in love with the modern decor, the friendly service, and the impressive menu of fresh, farm-to-table offerings. In addition to the delicious pot of freshly popped kettle corn, we also started with orders of Bruschetta and Black Pepper Wings, all of which were outstanding. But the Lobster Mac & Cheese we shared blew everything else away -- it was simply one of the best dishes I've had in a long time.For my main course, I ordered the Beef Short Ribs, which were absolutely dripping with flavor and slid right off the bone. My colleagues were equally impressed with their dishes, which ranged from the Center Cut Filet to the Yankee Pot Roast. There's also a solid selection of craft beers and cocktails, and a dessert menu that will have you begging for mercy.Founding Farmers is one of the most popular restaurants in Washington, and it's reputation is well deserved. If you're planning a visit to our nation's capital, make a reservation well in advance, or prepare yourself for a long wait. But don't let the crowds turn you off -- this is one meal that's worth standing in line for."
m p.,"Middlefield, CT",3/28/2017,5.0,The food is great and the prices very reasonable. Had a fantastic breakfast. The juice is fresh squeezed
Aarize D.,"Santa Clara, CA",5/11/2015,5.0,"SEXY TIME IN MY MOUTH FROM APPETIZER, ENTREE TO DESSERT!My friend and I went here for a late-ish lunch and thought we would be waiting at least 40 minutes for a table but it turned out that there was an available table in 5 minutes. We got so lucky. I was excited to eat at this place as my friend talked about Founding Farmers' food.FOOD:- Bacon Loli: HOLY CRAP! I just can't explain why this was so good of an appetizer... you have to try it. HAHA!- Chicken and Waffles with a side of Mint Watermelon: THIS IS THE BEST CHICKEN AND WAFFLES I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. West Coast Chicken and Waffles got nothing on this! Seriously, the fried chicken was not greasy/oily and it was oh so juicy. Thinking about this dish makes me wish that I'm still in DC eating this for dinner, lol. The dish also came with a very creamy mac n cheese and a side of Mint watermelon with Sea Salt. I don't think I could ever eat Chicken and Waffles from another place than Founding Farmers.DESSERT:- Deep Chocolate House-Churned Ice Cream: #sexytimeinmymouth. Oh my gawwwwd! It was more of a gelato quality than ice cream. It was very creamy, the Chocolate is very decadent, it didn't taste like I'm going to have diabetes type of dessert. It was a very well-done dessert. Very simple yet extraordinary dessert. I really enjoyed every single moment that I was eating it.SERVICE:Shout out to our server, John for taking care of us from beginning to when we were eating until the end! He was such a warm, friendly person to talk to! He also looked like Daniel Bryan, the WWE Intercontinental Champion pro-wrestler! OVERALL:Make sure to make reservations because this place is mad busy. We got lucky to walk-in for a table. I will be back! I will be devouring that Chicken and Waffles again and again! I will never eat Chicken and Waffles anywhere else than Founding Farmers :)SEXY TIME IN MY MOUTH FROM BEGINNING UNTIL THE END."
Kush P.,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",4/12/2017,3.0,"With such amazing reviews, this was a must go for the first DC trip. We made a reservation 2 weeks prior to our travel.The only time slot available was 4.45pm and we went ahead with it as we really wanted to experience it.My husband ordered a beer and I had orange soda which was quite refreshing after a lot of walking. We ordered two appetizers- Fried green tomatoes and corn bread. We found the tomatoes to be just ok in taste and quite oily.Corn bread served with honey and butter was moist with perfect level of sweetness. For the entree, we ordered a chicken pot pie which we decided to share between the two of us. The pie was well cooked with a crispy crust and big chunks of chicken, peas, carrots etc. Overall, It's good, but we expected something spectacular based on the 8K+ reviews. Not something which will make us visit it again. But If you plan to visit, do plan ahead and make a reservation."
Akanksha S.,"Ann Arbor, MI",9/5/2016,5.0,"I am in love with this place. I'm convinced that D.C. Does not have any bad place. We went for lunch. Please please make reservations because they take about 1-2 hours to seat you. But it's totally worth the wait. There is something about this place that really really gets you. The up class ambience, dressy people, spacious yet crowded seating area, signature dishes coming out of the kitchen, etc. I cannot stop talking about this place. We ordered the breakfast chicken and waffles, chicken pot pie, Turkey sandwich. Appetizers we tried: fried green tomatoes, chips, and devilish eggs. All of this was a lot for three of us. But we had to try these. Who knew fried tomatoes could be so delicious and crispy. Chicken and waffles is the combination I would've never tried but it was absolutely mind blowing. I ordered the Prisco Crusta which was very sweet and lemony. If you don't like sweet cocktails, ask the server and they will guide you."
Nakia C.,"Windsor Mill, Milford Mill, MD",5/7/2017,5.0,"The brunch is amazing balls .... The chicken and waffles are every single last thing .Oh and  the orange juice was super  fresh .If you are in DC please eat there ,but I do recommend reservations wait was long but we stalked a couple for their seats at the bar...."
Jae L.,"Baltimore, MD",8/20/2016,5.0,"Well worth the wait, but I hated the wait! We had 10am reservations on Sunday, but we missed it due to personal reasons. We arrived around 12:30pm MAJOR MISTAKE this place was packed! The hostess gave us an estimated wait time of 2 hours. Typically when an establishment says 2 hours, it's usually less- nope not this location. 2 hours really means, 2 hours! Luckily the weather was nice, so we waited outside on the bench. Once our name was called, we were seated upstairs near the window by the bar. There were about 4 tables and a long bench. This area is very tight but manageable. The prices for the food is located on the website.Bourbon Batter French Toast- this was great! The French Toast had a great crunch! Breakfast Chicken & Waffles- you can never go wrong with this dish. The chicken for this particular dish, were tenders. If you are not a fan of tenders, they have the same selection on the lunch side, which comes with a breast and wing I believe. This location does not appear to have any parking (I may be wrong), we took Uber.When I am in town, I will make sure to come again and stick to my reservation next time!"
Rita Y.,"Baltimore, MD",2/9/2016,5.0,"IF you're coming in on the weekends MAKE SURE you call ahead and get a reservation!! The lines are ridiculously long cause this place is THAT good. I made sure to make a reservation and we were ushered right in without a wait feeling smug looking at the line.. HahI've been hearing about this place from everyone and boy just looking at the photos on yelp I am so excited. We got the+ Seafood Devilish Eggs: They don't normally offer this for brunch (it's on the lunch menu). We asked the waiter about it and he said we could get it after 12 though :). THIS platter is just absolutely gorgeous. It comes with 4 different types of Deviled Eggs - Regular, Crab & Old Bay,  Smoked Salmon and Lobster. The Smoked Salmon was absolutely delicious. + Sausage & Gravy Eggs Benedict: Hmm this dish was one I didn't care too much for. It just tasted like a sausage mcmuffin from MCD with some gravy on top. + Fried Chicken & Mac and Cheese: You can't miss this dish! The chicken is so good and the mac and cheese is to die for."
Christine T.,"Silver Spring, MD",7/28/2016,2.0,The food was adequate but undistinguished.The menu is fabulous but the food itself does not live up to the promises the menu makes.  Sad.To be more clear. I was at the site in Potomac Place near the Harris Teeter store not in DC and the place was empty of customers except for me.
Maisha R.,"Jacksonville, FL",5/2/2015,3.0,"I like this place. I wasn't amazed by it, but it was good. A few friends and I met at FF midweek for dinner and the place was absolutely teeming with people. It was pretty unbelievable that it was that packed on a Wednesday night. Thankfully, we had reservations and after waiting about 15 minutes, we were taken upstairs to our table. Mike, our server, greeted us warmly and then Sam (perhaps the manager on duty?) came to our table and apologized for our wait. She even mentioned that she hoped the wait didn't ruin our experience. I thought that was a very nice gesture!I got the hibiscus soda and chicken and waffles, along with the cornbread for the table to start. Having grown up in the South, the cornbread was mediocre but I did like that it had real pieces of corn in it. However, it lacked flavor. The chicken and waffles was also underwhelming. While the portion size was good, the seasoning was very mild on the chicken and the waffle was rather hard. It essentially crumbled into pieces when I cut it. To his credit, Mike asked if we wanted our waffles cooked any special way and after tasting their ""default"" preparation, I would recommend asking for a soft waffle.After dinner, we considered dessert. Since one of my friends loves the beignets there, we went with an order of those and the chocolate ice cream. This was the highlight of the meal. The ice cream was so smooth and creamy it basically just melted in my mouth. That, along with the warm beignets - which take about 25 minutes to make (so order them early if you want them!) - was the perfect ending to the meal. Overall - 3.5 starsFood - 3 starsHospitality - 4 stars"

Updated review",4.0,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday with three of my friends. We had a 2:30 reservation, but had to wait about 15 minutes after our reservation time which was a bit annoying, but we were seated upstairs in a tucked away booth which was nice. We sat & waited for about 5+ minutes for our server, Grace to greet us. She got our drink order which was just four waters & one grapefruit juice but took 10+ minutes. We sat with our menus down because we were ready to order & another server came to take our order before the drinks even came. We ordered the Traditional Deviled Eggs & Skillet Cornbread with Butter & Honey as appetizers. The Deviled Eggs were okay, tasted more like egg salad but also was bland. The Skillet Cornbread was delicious, moist with pieces of corn in it.Most of us ordered the Chicken & Waffles (I was a little disappointed that they weren't serving brunch anymore). I order the Chicken & Waffles with Mac & Cheese & Mint Watermelon. BEST FRIED CHICKEN I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! Perfectly fried & crispy, well-seasoned & juicy chicken. The gravy was the icing on the cake, so delicious & paired perfectly with the chicken. The waffles were light & fluffy, but weren't anything special. The Mac & Cheese was good & cheesy but the noodles were a little hard. The Mint Watermelon was delicious & refreshing! For dessert we had the Beignets which were delicious! The outer shell was a little hard but the inside was fluffy & light. Needed a little more powered sugar in my taste but was still good. Overall, we had a great food experience but not service experience. We would definitely come back but hope we get a better server.My friend & I are server so we understand good service from bad pretty clearly. We didn't appreciate that our server had no sense of urgency & when we asked for plates that she just dropped them on the furtherest edge of the table & walked away. We did ask for gravy to go but she told us that it was too hot & would melt the ramekins but ended up putting some in a soup container which we appreciated. We just felt that she was annoyed the entire time with us after seeing another server take our order when she was returning with our drinks. All-in-all, we just appreciate good service & when we don't get it, we know. Everyone else that we encountered were polite & friendly as they greeted us or thanked us for coming in."
Veronique O.,"Lewes, DE",2/13/2017,2.0,"Made a reservation for a group of 8, we arrived 5 minutes early and they were running behind. We did not get seated until 40 minutes after our reservation time. They compted us a couple apps which was nice, but then it took over half an hour to get our drinks (two beers and a bottle of wine... Should have been very straightforward), they were completely out of IPAs (?!) and our dinner took well over an hour to come out. All in all, it took us three hours to have one round of drinks and dinner because of how late we were seated and the slow service. The food was tasty but I would not come back due to the really poor service."
Bethany O.,"Avondale, AZ",5/5/2017,5.0,Holy Cow! The French toast is out of this world and comes in a wonderfully large portion! My hubby had it but he kindly shared a couple bites with me. It's amazing. I had the farmer's breakfast which was also great. But next time I'm getting the French toast.
Felice S.,"Palo Alto, CA",3/31/2017,5.0,This place is awesome!!! Cornbread is a must. Great drinks and food. Definitely worth a visit!
Kerry W.,"Washington, DC",8/31/2016,4.0,"Food was delicious, sat at the bar and ordered a flatbread and a few other things. The Fig Flatbread was phenomenal. Not as veg friendly as I was expecting (May 2016). I have had their garden sandwich before, and it was okay; avocado makes things fall apart easily. As a beer drinker, I like to know what I'm drinking and ""amber"" or ""lager"" doesn't really cut it for me. I prefer Fishers Farmers Bakers, who, as I understand it, owns both. Loud, but you could hear the person next to you easily; people were hawking the bar seats and we barely finished before having to offer our seats to someone else due to their proximity."
Erin M.,"Arlington County, VA",5/23/2015,5.0,"I've eaten at Founding Farmers twice. Both visits have been for breakfast, once during the week and once on a weekend. The place can get busy, but they readily accept reservations both online and by phone. You'll likely get a better table (i.e. one that isn't ""shared"") if you make reservations. Regardless of how busy they've been though, our service experiences have been excellent though. The kitchen staff seems to keep up with the pace as well.As for the food, the stuffed French toast (bananas foster and strawberries and cream) was so amazing during our first visit that we ordered the same two items again on our second visit! Now, when I say the French toast is amazing, I am referring to a center of creamy, gooey goodness with a slightly crispy outside that has the power to actually make you enjoy your morning with a smile on your face!! Then, as if that wasn't enough, there's a large dollop of real whipped cream awaiting you on top of all that wonderful French toast. It's like the centerpiece to the whole wonderful experience. Personally, I opted to enjoy my incredible breakfast with a homemade, frothy chocolate milk, but that's just my personal choice. My wife instead enjoys their fresh, cold-pressed juices. Either way, we've both delighted in our Founding Farmer's breakfast experience thus far.A menu note....you'll find a range of healthy to not so healthy offerings. There's something for everyone! It's a nice eclectic place to visit when you don't know someone's individual food preferences, as both meat and non-meat lovers could be happy here."
Katelyn G.,"Westlake, OH",8/15/2015,5.0,"This place is fantastic. Everything is fresh, organic, certified green, and whatever else it is that people love these days! It was a Sunday night but we mistakenly tried to get a seat for 2 without reservations, wasn't gonna happen without an hour+ wait. Luckily bar seating was 1st come 1st serve and a couple (my new favorite people) called us aside saying they were just about done so we were quickly seated. To begin, the bartenders were phenomenal! The girls were always smiling and more than willing to help. And they made some good drinks, which is nice considering I would have been disappointed if my $12 Paloma didn't have the taste of tequila in it. The place was packed but our skillet cornbread (only $5!!) was out in a few minutes and main dishes were out within 15. Grilled cheese was so cheesy & delicious, tomato soup was good (can't mess that up or make it too stellar), and the mint watermelon was refreshingly different. $11 for grilled cheese/soup/side was not bad at all. Head over to this place out for any meal of the day!! I hope to go back for brunch, but based in the dinner experience it's gotta be great! Or check out the 6,000+ other great reviews Founding Farmers has, clearly this is the place to be!"
Jay P.,"Fairfax, VA",5/4/2017,3.0,"I like Founding Farmers, but it is my least favorite of their chains. The brunch pales in comparison to the others and the service is inconsistent."
John M.,"Glendora, CA",5/4/2017,5.0,"This place is amazing.  We went on a weeknight and it was packed.  We had a reservation but didn't get seated until 30 minutes after our reservation time - although this can be blamed at least partially on the fact that it was raining outside and so people finishing were slow to leave their tables.  Without asking, we were given 2 or 3 free delicious dishes as an apology for the wait.  Everything we ordered was excellent - very tasty and fresh.  Service was friendly and very attentive.  Most striking was that the prices are very reasonable considering the top quality of the food. I almost never give 5 stars but for this place it is a no brainer."
Miss C.,"Washington, DC",7/17/2017,1.0,Very disappointed! Saw the great reviews so I figured I go check the out! Took them over 15 mins to send a server to even come ask my table if we wanted something to drink! The food was average and the price a little high for the quality. I won't be going back!
Sydney V.,"Washington, DC",6/24/2017,5.0,Went for brunch and had great French toast. It was a bit on the heavy side but was totally delicious! Make sure to make a reservation though because it was packed!
Will C.,"Washington, DC",5/27/2015,4.0,"Finally I crossed Founding Farmers off my places to try! I am also very glad I came to this location and not the Tysons Corner location. From the Yelp reviews it doesn't seem like they are doing as well as the D.C. one. Alexis K and I decided to grab dinner here after walking around Georgetown on a Saturday around 6. At that time, the wait for 2 was 45 mins to an hour. They don't offer beepers so you are advised to check with the hostess once a certain time has elapsed. It took slightly less than an hour to get a seat, which is certainly not bad considering it was a Saturday and the amount of people in the restaurant (it was filled to the max). Their menu offers a variety of choices, and after some contemplation I went with the Yankee Pot Roast and my gf got the Chicken & Waffles. Usually pot roast at restaurants is pretty salty so I was a bit concerned to be honest. However, after one delicious bite my concern vanquished into thin air. The serving size for the pot roast was more then plenty. I am usually a pretty big eater but I barely finished my dish. The pot roast come with 2 huge slabs of meat, potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion. The chicken & waffle was also very good, the chicken was very moist. My gf has had their chicken at Tysons location and she says that it significantly better at this location. After our wonderful experience here at Founding Farmers I look forward to coming back to try out the many other items that captivated me. Now as far as their service goes, it was very good at the beginning but after the food came out we did not see our waitress. The empty plates and bowls sat on our table for probably 10 minutes before a manager came and removed it. Besides the lack of a waitress during our meal I would highly recommend this restaurant. Technically the Tysons location is way closer to my house but I still intend on frequenting the original location. The original one is always better. If you are in the area, make a reservation and give them a chance."
Tina M.,"Washington, DC",7/17/2017,3.0,"This place is a classic go-to for DC Visitors.  The food is fresh, and the staff is friendly, but with the number of restaurants in the area, I think this is a little overrated."
Mark O.,"West Palm Beach, FL",8/9/2015,4.0,6k+ reviews? Who needs one more? Exactly!!It's good. Start to finish its good. Good service. Good drinks. Don't miss the Beignets. Enjoy.
Johnny A.,"Washington, DC",8/27/2016,3.0,"Location, location, location. This is what Founding Farmers is about. Fantastic for hanging around the bar area and trying all types of different mixed drinks. Although, when I ask for a Hendricks gin, the bartender should know to use cucumbers without having to remind him. The vibe is lively and loud, which is great for a happy hour drinks and snacks. The food, though, is really just ok. Other than the bacon lollies, I can't really point to a memorable dish. Nothing bad, just average food. I'll stick with drinks and snacks."
Aarajahan H.,"Roxbury Crossing, MA",10/23/2016,4.0,"Let's begin with the wait. It's ridiculous, but understandable after eating. I do feel likeThe host do not follow their queue and instead seat certain people before others? I was told I was the next table and then 4 more people were called... The food compensates for the wait. Beignet dough was AMAZING light and fluffy inside and a variety of sweet dipping sauces. I had the chicken and waffles for my entree, with scrambled egg whites and cheese. It was the best chicken and waffle dish I've tried so far. Would recommend but make a reservation or be prepared for an hour wait on Sunday's"
Tanya W.,"Los Angeles, CA",10/23/2016,5.0,"Simply breathe taking after flying 5hrs .. u can only imagine my hunger .. best choice restaurant go sit at the bar I ordered--yankee pot roast, two corn breads, and salad... perfect...delicious ...and it's still on my mind 3 days later"
Apryl S.,"Farmington, MI",2/27/2016,4.0,Probably the busiest brunch place I've been to in DC. The wait was 1hr so make reservations if possible. Tried the crab Benedict. Crab and egg was cooked to perfection. You can also get fresh squeezed juice. Prices are reasonable.
Tasha C.,"Austin, TX",7/16/2017,5.0,The staff was super polite and the food tasted amazing. I really recommend getting the corn on the cob as a side dish. It's the best!
Astrid Z.,"Berkeley, CA",1/4/2016,5.0,"Hands down the best meal I had during my time in DC.Food: I ordered the crab cakes ($30 )with a side of candied lemon green beans and the autumn succotash. The succotash had a good balance of sweet/savory flavors - composed of root veggies, it contained sweet potato and a few other root veggies... the sweet potato stuck out to me the most. The crab cakes were delightful and cooked to perfection, good balance of seasoning and a generous portion of crab and not just the other filler stuff most places pack into crab cakes. Green beans were simple and fresh. My boyfriend ordered the chicken & waffles ($16) with a side of mac n cheese and sweet potato. The waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, it came with a side of syrup and butter, but they were so tasty and sweet alone, we really didn't need to add the condiments. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy. I usually remove the fried part, which defeats the purpose, but this time I didn't. The skin was so tasty, I couldn't stop eating it. I really enjoyed the sweet potato, it was very sweet with hints of maple and pecan chunks. It pairs well with the savory mac n cheese/chicken. I highly recommend it for those wanting a good balance of sweet/savory in one entree. Service: Amazing! They were extremely busy, but our server was attentive at all times. She was very descriptive and helpful when explaining the menu and drink options.Price: Pricey, yet a steal for the quality/quantity of food you get. Most entrees range from $15-$30.Overall: Amazing experience. I dined around 6pm on a weeknight and they quoted my wait time for 3 people to be 30 mins, but actually sat us down within 15 minutes of waiting. Everything on the menu is made in-house and from scratch, including their drinks. The food is delicious, service is fast/friendly and the prices are reasonable for all that you get. I highly recommend Founding Farmers & can't wait until I visit again."

Updated review",4.0,"My most recent visit to Founding Farmers was for lunch on a weekday. We had prior reservations and got there promptly on time. It did take us close to 20 minutes to be seated at our table. Service too was less than stellar for our latest visit :(Now for the good stuff :) The rest of the experience was, as expected, very good! I tried the Jerk Soda, which was Raspberry. I am generally not a fan of Raspberry but this was really good; the tartness sure did wake me up! For the main course I ordered 3 Hot Dogs - with Tomato Chow Chow, Chili, and Crab cake. The crab cake was not technically a hot dog but was very flavorful. The 2 hot dogs were good too - I preferred the tomato chow over the chili by a hair.The dish size is like other FF dishes - enough food to put you in a food coma, or yummy leftovers for an evening snack in my case :)Founding Farmers does remain at the top of our most favored restaurants in DC!"
Wayne K.,"Kings Mountain, NC",4/17/2017,4.0,"Excellent food and tons of choices.  Chicken and waffles was excellent. Service was not great, very slow. Orange house made soda is not great either.  Pretty expensive."
Angela H.,"Washington, DC",5/1/2017,5.0,"Went for my boss birthday in April 2017. We had the deviled eggs, cornbread, chicken /waffles, pork chops and fish/chips. EVERYTHING was wonderful."
Jenny K.,"Bellevue, WA",4/19/2015,3.0,"I came here on a Thursday afternoon around 1:30pm and the place was packed! I was quoted a 45 minute wait time for a table of one, so I headed to the bar in hopes that I'd find a seat, and I'm so glad I did. I squeezed into the last empty seat and waited for 10 minutes before I got some water and a menu.I quickly decided on the steak and enchilada plate with a glass of Russian River Pinot Noir. The wine was an excellent choice and was poured for me very quickly. Food followed in about 10 minutes. The plate had a corn on the cob with some cotija cheese and seasonings, a flank steak with a cilantro chutney and two chicken enchiladas with a dollop of sour cream on top. The corn was delicious but a pain to eat because I refused to grab it with my hands, and wanted to slice off the kernels using a fork and knife. I spent about 3 minutes getting as much of the corn off as possible before starting my meal. The steak was cooked and seasoned well but I wasn't sure that it complemented the chicken enchiladas well. Also, the enchiladas would've been ever better with some extra sauce and spices.After finishing about 3/4 of the plate, I realized I wasn't full yet. Instead of finishing the plate, I decided to order another entree. There wasn't anything wrong with the original entree but I figured I came all the way here from out of town and this dish wasn't really mind blowing like I had hoped. So, with the bartender's recommendation, I ordered the shrimp and grits with a glass of their house brand rye whiskey. The shrimp and grits looked more like a stew, which was unexpected, but the flavors were really delicious! Also I had previously only had the shrimp and grits as a brunch item so was initially surprised not to see poached eggs on top. There were giant pieces of shrimp, chunks of veggies and really good grits that had soaked up the broth. The rye was legit, and my favorite from this trip.I would avoid lunching here if you're in a rush. But, I recommend it if you have a few hours for a leisurely meal. Large enough drinks and food selection for a multi course meal, and lively fun atmosphere."

Updated review",1.0,"I went here for a third time against all my inclinations. The first two times (2009 and 2015) and the third (May 2016) was a disaster. I read the Washington Post Food Critic Review and I completely, 100% agree. I only went because my friend wanted to eat here and shes moving out of the country. I begged for another brunch location, but she insisted. The waitress was a mess. She could not properly describe the food, and mistakenly said that the chicken and waffles was ""well seasoned."" No its not. At the bare minimum, this restaurant should soak the chicken before frying it. Its clear that if anything, there is a quick dash of salt right before it is fried. Not to mention that the food arrived cold. Being the veteran that I am, I knew not to order anything of substance. I ordered a burger, which was overcooked (I asked for medium well) and not well constructed. We had beignets which were too greasy. Once we were finished eating the beignets, no one came to clean up our table. When the mains came out, I said ""we don't have any space"" and the waiter just looked at me. So I proceeded to bus my own table...and then I'm still expected to give tip? The food was a disappointment for a third time. I have no one to blame but myself for entertaining this bad food on account of satisfying my friends' wishes. Others in our group were horrified by the service and food as well. There are so many better places for Brunch and I implore you to stop supporting this wretched establishment."
Deb M.,"Shoreline, WA",3/21/2017,3.0,"Went during Restaurant week and won't be back anytime soon (if ever). Aesthetically pleasing and location is great. I ordered the chicken wings and was disappointed. The batter is so heavy I think it made up 50% of my meal if not more. Chicken was also not seasoned which threw off the whole meal. My friend ordered the sweet potato pasta and couldn't stomach more than one bite. We ended up getting donuts for desert and they were stale, seeming to have been sitting out for awhile."
Jane P.,"Baltimore, MD",1/5/2016,3.0,"I feel like I'm always disappointed when I go to Founding Farmers. I always have such a high expectation for this place, but end up getting mediocre food and really slow service. I got the goat cheese ravioli and this was okay. It was delicious for the first couple of bites, but it started to get really sickening after a while. The ravioli was good. It was soft and had a creamy filling. I also liked the chicken on top of my ravioli, but the sauce was way too floral and citrusy. I usually get their chicken and waffles, but didn't get them this time around because I always regret getting it. The chicken and waffle is okay, but definitely just pretty rather than delicious. I usually can never finish more than half of it.  We also ordered their kettle corn. It was HUGE. I wasn't expecting so much of it. This was pretty good. It was not super sweet, which I enjoyed and the kettle corn came in a cute bucket.   Their service here is horrible. You have to make sure you have a big chunk of your day portioned out to come to this place. It takes forever to get a table and once you get the table you wait around a lot for your servers to come to you. They aren't attentive to your needs and you need to constantly remind them about what you need. They seem to forget a lot. All in all, it's a cute place to come to eat, but don't expect mind blowing food or exceptional service."
Jessie C.,"Pleasanton, CA",7/15/2017,4.0,"Love this place! I bring out of town guests here all the time. My favorite dish to order is the Chicken and Waffles with Mac and Cheese. I have also tried their beignets and french toast-- delicious if you would like a sweeter option for brunch. Their beignets' texture is perfect. Totally try to make reservations if you are trying to eat during the weekend. Otherwise, the wait can be long during that time."
aj c.,"Takoma Park, MD",4/30/2017,5.0,Last time I went it would a great experience.  It is an interesting contrast to have good solid food without the fussy atmosphere or some DC places.  It is a nicer restaurant without the huge price.
Laura W.,"Washington, DC",1/4/2016,4.0,"I realize everyone and their third cousin twice removed as reviewed Founding Farmers already, however, I highly enjoyed my recent experience here, and thought I'd share.......Before my recent dinner experience at Founding Farmers, I had always associated this restaurant with brunch. It was only after I was looking for an early dinner on NYE prior to seeing a show at the Kennedy Center, that I realized Founding Farmers had not only stellar brunch reviews, but a host of positive dinner reviews as well. When I booked the reservation on Opentable (which I HIGHLY recommend doing-the reservation, not necessarily Opentable), the 6:45pm time was still available, with the next time not being until 8:45pm. Given that our show started at 9:00pm, 6:45 was perfect for us and allowed a leisurely dinner in addition to ample time to take the shuttle over to the Kennedy Center. We arrived promptly at 6:45pm to a packed lobby. I agree with other reviewers that the ""lobby"" space is quite small, so it can be a bit uncomfortable if you are waiting for them to prepare your table and seat you. Luckily, we were seated in a spacious booth after waiting only 5 minutes. I loved the atmosphere-casual and cozy yet intimate and dimly lit. This seems like it's not only a good date spot but also a nice spot to catch up with a group of friends. Our sever was wonderful throughout our meal! She was never pushy to clear us out when it was evident we were pacing our courses and enjoying our drinks despite the fact the restaurant was quite busy. She was patient, helpful, and present when we needed something but in no way intrusive. Really, the service experience was a delight!Founding Farmers has a variety of drinks, specializing in cocktails including their ""made in house"" syrups. What I found most enticing about the drink menu was the pricing, specifically on bottles of wine. I am not a cocktail person so, given the minimal beer selection, wine was the best option for myself. No bottle of wine was priced over $45, which is a rare find given the typical restaurant mark-up on bottles. The least expensive bottles were $24, and considering the average price of the cocktails here is $12, this seems like a rather good deal. We chose a ""higher end"" Sauvignon Blanc and really enjoyed it with our meals. After reading (ie: stalking) multiple reviews of Founding Farmers, I 99.9% (with the smidge of doubt being if my boyfriend did not feel the same way, but luckily he agreed with my suggestions) knew what I wanted to order already based on the rash of positive reviews for these chosen items. I have an infatuation with down-home Southern comfort food with a twist, and this surely did deliver! We began with the brie farm bread, consisting of brie and apples layered on toasted baguettes topped with onion jam. I'm glad my boyfriend is not much of an onion fan because that was my favorite aspect of this particular dish, and I savored the onion jam to the last drop! The melding of the sweet, sour, and salty flavors proved to be quite the flavor explosion. On my next visit, I plan on trying the prosciutto farm bread with fig, mascarpone, and balsamic. Any of the farm bread options seem like a perfect way to whet the appetite before the main event. So about that main event.......while many items stood out (including the chicken pot pie, the chicken and waffles, and the short rib), I knew I wanted in on both the shrimp and grits with andouille and the Yankee pot roast. My strategy: get my boyfriend to order one and I'll order the other. Our meals came out fairly quickly after ordering and were piping hot upon arrival. The shrimp and grits was on point! Tender, plump shrimp combined with an ample amount of sausage in a savory broth-amazing flavors! Definitely recommend ordering this dish! The pot roast was excellent as well-tender chunks of meat that were well-seasoned, hearty root vegetables, and a delicious brown gravy, all served over mashed potatoes and topped with crispy onion straws (which I found superfluous but I'm not a fan of crispy onions). There was a lot more gravy, however, left when I had finished the rest of the dish, and I only wished I'd had some sort of rustic bread (preferably sourdough) to sop up the remaining gravy and juices. I, actually, felt the same way about the shrimp and grits too. While we were not able to save room for dessert, the chocolate mousse bowl for 2 looks like a chocoholics dream so on my next visit, I will be back for not only dessert but their infamous brunch experience too!"
Liana P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",4/30/2017,4.0,"If you're willing to wait the long line, it's definitely worth it. We were told an hour wait but ended up being nearly 2 hours. Service is ok, not anything spectacular. But the food makes up for it. I got the hangover hash...out of this world. Poached eggs over hash browns, cheese, vegetables and chorizo. Beyond delicious, would definitely Get it again!! My husband and I also split a strawberries and cream waffle, the waffle was crunchy and the vanilla cream on top of the waffle was the perfect amount of sweetness! Everything on the menu sounded delicious, will come again next time I'm in town."
Mark C.,"Boston, MA",9/17/2016,4.0,"Holy moly, the barbeque sauce they put on the bacon is incredible. The beignets are incredible. I was incredibly full by the time my pancakes came out, but they were pretty good, too.There's a small bathroom on the first floor, but there's more bathroom up on the second floor (take the elevator)."
Kristen S.,"Smithtown, NY",7/31/2016,4.0,"An awesome breakfast. I'm a huge Bloody Mary fan and this place had a fierce one. The bacon is a pure piece of hearty pig heaven. The wait staff for the most part were very friendly. The hostess was a bit snippy, but the waiter next to her totally smoothed over her sharpness. It was packed. The Brooklyn egg cream was fair. The stuffed French toast was definitely worth writing home about. Will be back."
Adelyn P.,"Bowie, MD",8/20/2016,5.0,"Many know this place is top notch. Must have a reservation. From drinks to desert, perfection. I really enjoyed my enchiladas. Calling them enchiladas does not do them justice. They are kinda deconstructed. Special occasion? Have it at Founding Farmers."
Karen P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3/25/2017,5.0,Yummy!! Very tasty menu...EVERYTHING was delicious!! Especially loved the cornbread!  Great service too!
Jenna K.,"Rutherford, NJ",4/19/2016,4.0,"The food was fresh and delicious. Not too salty or spicy, the seasoning was perfect. I like the mood as well. Even Drinks i could feel freshness lol"
Virley L.,"San Francisco, CA",2/10/2016,4.0,"Great location, plenty of tables, clean Meyers-products filled restrooms. Food was yum. Bf got the chicken pot pie, but was disappointed that it didn't actually come as a pie. He said it was still good. I got the shrimp and fries plate. The cornbread was good, even with bits of actual corn.The service was subpar, and we came in at 4pm on a Monday (not packed/not busy). The hostess said that she had a reservation at that table 5:30, so we had to be out by then... UH OKAY COOL GIRL. There were literally about 20 other tables empty. And I'm pretty sure it's not gonna take me an hour & half to grab a bite to eat."
Veto L.,"Arlington, VA",5/6/2017,5.0,I had amazing diner here with six of my frinds we all love this food and the servise is amazing thank you for everything
N J.,"Hanover, MD",4/28/2017,4.0,"Just ate here today the food was awesome! I had the chicken and waffles and it was really good.  The portions were huge and the chicken was very flavourful. It came with a breast and a thigh, mac & cheese, and green beans.  You also should try the corn bread it was great. I will definitely be coming back!"
Neha A.,"Chicago, IL",8/18/2016,2.0,"I do not get the hype at. all. I've been here for brunch, lunch, and happy hour/apps. Each and every time I thought my food was way too heavy. Not necessarily greasy, but just made with too much butter/cheese and it just didn't have that California fresh taste I was hoping for. I understand the ingredients are local and organic, etc. but I thought local and organic would translate to a more fresh and light meal. It's been a couple years since I've been here, so maybe the menu and style of cooking has changed a bit. But I've given it enough chances to know that I don't like it. I think if you like southern style food (which to me means on the heavier side) you'll probably enjoy this."
Sorcha D.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",4/28/2017,5.0,Honestly founding farmers was a stop on our way back To NY from D.C. and it was probably my favorite meal we had the entire trip. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was amazing!!!!
Roxana F.,"New York, NY",1/21/2016,5.0,"Holy freaking yum! My former coworker suggested I check this place out if I was ever in DC, and I'm really glad I listened to him! I came here on a Tuesday night around 8:30 and it was packed. Grabbed a seat at the bar and my bartender was such a sweetheart. I told her what spirits and flavors I liked and she recommend this swizzled rum drink which certainly did not disappoint--and was fun to watch them make. I was debating between shrimp n grits and the chicken n waffles, but my bartender said she always orders the chicken n waffles and BOY I was not disappointed. The chicken was tender and flavorful, the batter was perfectly done and not too greasy, and the waffle was light and airy and frickin delicious--so much so I tried to order just the waffle for dessert but sadly they don't do that. The next time I'm in DC I'll definitely be heading back here again!"
Kevin J.,"Washington, DC",12/5/2016,5.0,"I very rarely give outstanding reviews, but the food here is unbelievable. Everything was brought out in well-crafted form and the food was quite flavorful. Definitely try their fried green tomatoes - the goat cheese spread is amazing. Definitely a must visit.As well, the chain is farmer-focused, which is a big deal for not only myself but many other millennials. Their focus on the farmer and ensuring that all food is natural and wholesome is unparalleled. Great food for a great price - definitely come here for dinner or lunch, but make sure you have reservations!"
RL P.,"Arlington, VA",12/4/2016,5.0,"Dinner last Friday night with the family. Good and service was excellent. Thanks to our server Jose for making my Mom's visit to DC extra special, or should I say especial.Chicken soup, chicken bucatini, chicken and waffles, pot roast were ordered. All delicious.See you next time."
Ray S.,"New York, NY",4/13/2017,4.0,Tasty comfort food and satisfying portions of it at good prices. Wait for table is long on weekends so I recommend eating at the bar if you're solo or with one or two people to avoid the wait. It's the same menu.
Nick F.,"Manhattan, NY",9/23/2016,4.0,"This is my go to joint when I'm rolling through DC.  The maple butter and cornbread are always on point, and the hipster waitstaff are genuinely engaged on the specials.  The beer list boasts local DC brands which is great, and the only gripe is the cost that racks up when you keep ordering.Brunch is also great if you go for something carb-heavy."
Amber T.,"Fishers, IN",1/12/2016,5.0,"If you are in town visiting or if you are a local, this restaurant is a must-try.  Hands-down this was the best meal we had on our vacation to D.C. and there are lots of great place to eat.The location is ideal for tourists seeing as how it is just a short trek away from the White House.  We arrived here bright and early on a week day so there was no wait and service was prompt.  The restaurant had a hipster vibe and I felt cool just eating there.  Not only was the ambiance amazing, it is also environmentally responsible.  The restaurant refuses to serve plastic, even our straws were made out of corn. So cool! Now for the food, imagine my surprise and delight when I saw four different types of eggs benedict! I felt like I had just hit the farm-to-table jackpot.  I ordered the crab eggs benedict and it was sooooo amazing! I have dreams about it now! It was a little pricey (14$) but 100% worth it!  My son got the oatmeal for 5$ and it was the best damn oatmeal I had ever tasted!  It was a huge portion and was presented beautifully with all the goodies on the side (nuts,cream,dried fruit, brown sugar).I just left this place feeling great and FULL which doesn't always happen in farm-to-table places.  Great comfort food and amazing service. You can't lose eating here."
Joe O.,"Woodrow, Staten Island, NY",4/12/2017,5.0,Fantastic breakfast! The omelettes were cooked perfect and the steel cut oats were so fresh tasting. The coffee and Orange juice was pretty awesome as well. I would highly recommend for breakfast and hope I can go back for dinner someday.
Rachael P.,"Washington, DC",7/12/2015,5.0,"Love love love! I've been here three different times as well as their sister restaurant, Farmers Fishers and Bakers in Georgetown (also writing a review for them after this!). The bread with brie, apples, and some sort of onion jam thing is a must have! It's a great restaurant to go to because it's got a great interior, location, and variety of dishes! The sausage mushroom gnocchi is SO GOOD. Sweet, spicy, and creamy in one dish which was amazing. I've also had their roasted vegetable and avocado sandwich for lunch which is a great pick. Both times I've only eaten half and the second half is great later on in the day or the next day! I ordered the pearl pasta side and I'm glad I did. Finally, I've had their chicken bolognese bucatini which is the first dish I've ever had here. Once again, fantastic. You can't go wrong by going here.Definitely make a RESERVATION! I always do no matter what time of day. I went 2:00 pm on a Tuesday and I probably wouldn't have needed one, but I've been at 12:30 on Friday and it was PACKED."
Shifaa W.,"Rockville, MD",4/12/2017,4.0,Excellent service and very flavorful food. The wait can be long so make your reservation ahead of time.
Miguel C.,"Miami, FL",4/12/2017,4.0,Food is really good.  Red velvet pancakes and Eggs Benedict I would recommend. Beignets are spectacular. Service was so-so (good service would have made it 5 stars).
Danielle M.,"Temple Hills, MD",2/14/2016,4.0,"After going to Founding Farmers last night I really think I need to go again to give a full assessment. It was my friend's 30th birthday and we went to celebrate with her in a small, intimate group. The service was great, I have no complaints in that area. The food was also good but I have a really bad cold and could not enjoy it. I got the black pepper garlic wings and chicken and waffles. I also sampled the corn bread, which seemed slightly undercooked in the center. While everything tasted pretty good I could barely eat. After a few bites I had to stop. Sooooo this gives me an excuse to go back, try again and leave a better review! Can't wait! But for now I'll nurse myself back to health in order to make that possible."
Tiffany W.,"San Diego, CA",6/28/2016,4.0,We had to check out the famous Founding Farmers in DC so we stopped there for some breakie (breakfast). The Bourbon French Yoast and the Ham and Eggs were ordered. The French Toast is crispy and has a fried\ churro taste to it - it was good! The ham and eggs were just that ham and eggs; eggs were on the sweeter side which was different but the potato hash was delish and ham was flavored nicely. All the portions are huge so you could definitely share depending on how hungry you are. Service was a little slower but over all it was good experience. WiFi was down when I was there but the waiter said that they usually have it available.
Renee B.,"Washington, DC",2/3/2017,1.0,"My girlfriend and I had a reservation for 1300...1 hour later we were seated.  People seated at the bar (walk ins) were served food and drinks while we waited with all the other reservations.  Overbooked!  The food was cold and not edible.  The manager came over to apologise but didn't change much; overbooked, food was cold and mediocre, and I don't see myself going back."
Reynaldo P.,"Dorado, Puerto Rico",7/26/2016,4.0,"Definitely worth the time and every penny. Washington DC is not a cheap city, and Founding Fathers is not a cheap joint. It is however reasonably priced and offers a great value;1) We made reservations and bypassed a huge line of people that were walked ins. Highly recommended using Open Table or any other reservations platform. 2) They have great breads and spreads as appetizers. Bacon Lollis have a lot of mentions here and were suggested by the waiter. If you have ever been to Fogo de Chao, and had the bacon there, then skip these. $10 for a a few strips on a sticks is a bit much. 3) speaking of breads, the cornbread is amazing. 4) Portions are huge. Chicken and waffles are very good. Mac and cheese is unique. 5) interesting take on pot pie. Biscuit on top was divine 6) meatloaf was over-seasoned, but the mashed potatoes made up for it. Service was OK. It was crowded, but they covered our table correctly. All things considered, this was a great experience. I would recommend it."
Jellian M.,"Murrieta, CA",3/30/2017,5.0,Went in one night for dessert and had the shareable chocolate mousse. It was so yummmyyyy! Went in a couple days later for breakfast...I had the chicken and waffles! Amazing! Service was also really good :) great atmosphere allowed my husband and I to catch up with an old friend. Can't wait to come back to D.C.!
JC R.,"Washington, DC",8/11/2016,4.0,"Good burgers & tap!, oh you know what I mean..."
Stephanie J.,"San Diego, CA",4/11/2017,2.0,"So many good reviews , so disappointed.20 mins just to check in with rezzies ! Cramped in waiting area, service slow to acknowledge but as much as Brandon could - he was quite nice. Food was so so- seriously!? So so after waiting so long! Husbands beer came warm (!) , chips/bread came  with 4 very small plastic cups (!) of not very flavorful dips. Salad came with cheap iceberg lettuce and white sections of Napa cabbage. This location is probably busy every minute of every day.... good for them- I guess. Took a long look since will not be returning."
Julie M.,"Columbus, OH",4/23/2017,5.0,"Hands down our favorite restaurant in DC! Amazing, high quality food for a great price. One of the few places my 6'1"" Ohio-born husband can eat in DC and be full at the end of it :) Definitely get a reservation for weekends or you'll be waiting for hours to get a table."
D S.,"Madison, IN",3/7/2017,4.0,I wanted to love this place but left just liking it.   Tables are too close.  It's too busy and I felt rushed.   The food was very good. Try the bacon!!  Wow!!    Wine is best by the bottle and you can take it home!
Kaitlyn G.,"Philadelphia, PA",3/7/2017,4.0,"We came here for brunch in a busy Saturday morning, thank God we had a reservation! The place was packed. We only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated which wasn't bad at all! The servers were so nice and goofy and sweet and made it a fun atmosphere! The menu is perfect just enough so you don't get overwhelmed! I had the bananas foster waffle and the mushroom, spinach and I think tomato scrambler! Both were delicious! My boyfriend had the blueberry pancakes and chicken and waffle (he was super hungry!) the pancakes were soooo good! Loaded with blueberries just the way I like them! We will surely return next time we are in town!"
Kelley B.,"District Heights, MD",4/23/2017,5.0,We love this restaurant . The food and drinks are amazing . I think we have been to all the farmers In DC
Kyle S.,"Westminster, CA",4/9/2017,3.0,"Wonderful food, great atmosphere, incredibly popular. However its gets excessively crowded for reservations/ walk in where you can hardly stand (I think the overbook on reservations) and it seem to be unorganized due to waiting an hour because they forgot to seat my guest and I even after we checked in for our reservation. The food was pleasant and it came out quickly. I highly recommend the eggs Benedict, however the Mimosas were adequate and little over priced.  I think it's a pleasant place to come to if not for the headache of waiting and dealing with mix ups due to the sheer number of people simply waiting for a seat and waiting on their reservations for that matter. Could be better if it was a bit more organized."
Phil C.,"Bellmore, NY",3/28/2017,4.0,Founding Farmers seems to be all that it is reported to be.  Excellent food and pleasant service. Went there for Sunday brunch and faced an hour and a half wait.  Instead of waiting on a table we ate at the bar which was about a 15 minute wait after standing behind a couple who were well into their meal.  The food is excellent and the service is fast once you get your order in.  If you want a wonderful breakfast experience in the middle of Washington DC and have some patience this is the place to go.
Nicole P.,"Wallingford, CT",10/28/2016,5.0,"Waffles are my favorite bananas are my second favorite. I got the banana fosters waffles and my mouth is still watering. Absolutely obsessed with Founding Farmers. If you're in DC you must go here, you will not be disappointed."
Abigail B.,"Washington, DC",7/10/2017,4.0,"The food is great, nice service and lovely atmosphere. My favorite is the chicken and waffles."
Deanna L.,"Manhattan, NY",8/6/2016,2.0,"Love the concept but one thing is missing - healthy options, greens, veggies, it's from North Dakota farm collective, which is awesome but the plates look like they are made for farmers about to do manual labor, big portions and hearty so watch the waste line. Didn't find the service exceptional and the wait is a huge deterrent especially w gorgeous French bakery ""Paul"" next door."
Jerry M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",6/11/2016,5.0,"Absolutely wonderful!  Well worth a short walk away from the mall.  Service was excellent.  Absolutely no complaints.  Order the beignets at the start of your meal, as they can take 30 minutes if they don't have any ready. Best summer drink - Constitution."
Dylan Keith W.,"Honolulu, HI",12/14/2015,1.0,"I'm an extremely merciful reviewer. Out of over 50 reviews in my short time here, only one other place has gotten a 1 star and most get at least a 3 or above. So when I rank a place a 1, that should tell you I'm being serious about it being bad. We had reservations, but were still told to wait probably about half an hour beyond our schedule. So, poor time management. And for having a reservation, they made us sit at an awkwardly placed standalone table rather than something better like a booth when you make a reservation.I ordered a sort of platter with various sample on it; it was supposed to be a couple of slider burgers, some pork ribs, a chili dog, and a couple of sides. When After I got my food, I noticed the hot dog wasn't there. So I asked my waiter, and they told me that they ran out so they just gave me another slider. Now, I'm not one to throw a fit over a hot dog, but like, you could have told me you were out of a certain part of the platter and maybe if I really freaking loved chili dogs then I wouldn't have ordered that lol.Also, I was annoyed at the drink menu. They serve a TON of alcohol, but I don't like to drink like that when I'm eating. Even though I usually don't drink soda, that's usually my go-to when eating out because I don't just want to sip on water either. But they don't have any soda on tap. The closest thing are these weird cream mixed drinks, one of which I ordered, and was absolutely terrible.And overall it's just not the place for me. It was overcrowded, I can't recall any good ambiance, it was slow, and as far as I'm concerned, my order was wrong and mishandled. So this is definitely a place I wouldn't go back to."
Bertha C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",8/31/2016,4.0,"Mmm mmm good. Hubby and I tried this place tonight for the first time and it was great. Hubby order the filet with red potatoes and mint watermelon and I had the chicken and waffles with with Mac n cheese and green beans.  Hubby was very satisfied with his meal and the steak was cooked perfectly. Waffle was a little crispy and Mac n cheese tasted better after adding hot sauce. Service was great and atmosphere was nice, so it made it a great place to relax after work. Will visit again and try other items on the menu."
Virginia Y.,"San Francisco, CA",4/1/2015,3.0,"DO NOT COME HERE WITHOUT RESERVATIONS! I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE WITHOUT RESERVATIONS!! I came here once and was told the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour. It was around 8 or 9 at that time so I went somewhere else for grub. I made reservations for another time to come back, I'm a huge fan of farm to table so I wanted to see what Founding Farmers was about. I thought it might've been one of the first restaurants that opened up in DC like Old Ebbitt Grill but turns out it's only been around for about 10 years. This place must be crazy good then if the demand for seats are so high. When I finally came for my reservations, I wasn't seated right away.. I even came early and still waited at least 40 minutes. I thought to myself, "" Good food takes time, it's going to be worth it."" When my name was finally called, I was brought upstairs to their booth style seating. I ordered the bacon lollis, prime rib with two sides which were kale and pecan candied sweet potato.The server mentioned to me that they had a special home made soda for the day and it was passion fruit, feeling intrigued I opted for it. Our food took a while to come and we started getting pretty hungry. Luckily the bubbly drink kept us busy. The bacon lollis weren't filling since they were so thin and it was about 4-5 pieces. The steak took a while but it finally came around, it was served with aujus sauce and horseradish sauce. The sides were so and so, I found the sweet potato to be too candied for my liking. The kale was worse, more like what kale?? It was mostly cabbage... and it was pretty tasteless.The main star was definitely the prime rib, the aujus sauce compliments it much better than the horseradish. During midway through our meal we ran out of sauce and wanted to ask our server for more but she was no where to be found. We stopped eating because we didn't want to eat the prime rib without the sauce. We kept looking around for her but she wasn't in sight at all. She hardly checked up on us, when we finally saw her we tried to wait for that ""eye contact"" moment but it never happened so we just politely waited. When she finally came around we got our sauce but it was frustrating that we had to wait this long.. When we finally wrapped up our main course we opted for dessert. We decided on the beignets, they sounded the most intriguing on the menu. Con? It would take about 30 minutes to make and have it served. (SO THAT'S WHY THE WAIT TAKES SO LONG HERE!!! DING DING DING) Luckily I had no other plans later in the evening so I was okay with the wait time. When they finally came, it was presented as powdered sugar donut holes served with 3 sauces. The sauces were raspberry, caramel and chocolate. My favorite was the chocolate. I wish the beignets were softer and less sweet since the sauces were already sweet enough. A few improvements that could be made at Founding Farmers is the service and wait time. Possibly hire more chefs or servers? I feel like they can't seem to handle the overwhelming amount of consumers. It was a long wait to get a table, a long wait for the food and a long wait for service. If they managed the place better with more staff, people would be coming in and out a lot quicker and it would allow them to cater to more people."
Margaret L.,"Falls Church, VA",4/21/2017,5.0,LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!!! I think the food was amazing and out of this world! I would go back everyday if I could but it seemed to be a little pricey but the flavors were a blast of deliciously goodness
Janet H.,"Schwenksville, PA",8/21/2016,3.0,"I dont know how I feel about this place, every time my bf and I visit Washington DC we always want to try a brunch place. We tried to make a reservation for around 11/12 but was only able to get one for 2:15pm. For some reason we always run late for 15 min so I called before and they said that it was okay and that theres a 15 min grace period, and of course we made it. We checked in and was seated in maybe about 5 min. Service: This was one of the reasons for the low stars. Our waiter was really eh, he didnt do much at all. He got us our drinks and put in our order but that was about it. I saw him a total of 3 times throughout our meal, one was to get our drinks, two was to get our order and third was the check. Our app came out but was brought out by very nice lady who realized we didnt have plates and immediately came back with some. My bf and I realized that we didnt even have utensils or a napkin and she was very sorry and told us that it was their fault. We werent mad or anything, but she handled it extremely well esp for not being our waiter. Our waiter didnt even realize that he gave us nothing. She's the reason I didnt give this place 2 stars.Food: so when we arrived, i was a little disappointed because they werent serving brunch :( it was the lunch/dinner menu which was also 2x more expensive. I prefer brunch food than lunch and dinner but since we were already there. we ordered the black pepper wings, these were amazing!!! They came in a huge portion, maybe around 10-12 wings. It was enough to be a regular entree. Next I ordered, crabcakes and they were full of meat and no fillers. the only thing was that it was so salty i could only eat one of them :( A little upsetting since the dish i ordered was 30 dollars... Anyways my bf got the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was good. I mean how can you mess up grilled cheese lol. Overall, it wasnt a bad experience but I def think its overhyped. Maybe next time we will reserve for brunch time. It's a little pricey but the portions are a good size. I def prefer Old Ebitt grill."
Kim H.,"Fort Washington, MD",10/24/2016,3.0,"I visited this very well known DC fab food spot for the first time last week for lunch and was very pleased with my overall experience.  The food and service was good.  TIP: Be sure to pre reserve your table on Open table.Today I went to order my lunch to go. I sat at the bar and my order was taken pretty quickly.  After about 30 mins or more,  I asked the bartender if he could check on the status of my food. Lo and behold it had been sitting at the other end of the bar for a while.  I was told at that time that there were no bags to put my order in and no spoons or utensils. Yikes, I'd walked a few blocks and now I'd have to carefully carry my soup and other items. So nothing dropped or spilled.  And trying to simply get out of the door during lunchtime here is a feat within itself.Founding Farmers was a lovely sit down experience yet NOT so lovely carryout experience.  Would have given at least 4 stars for overall and 5 for the quality of the food had I at least been given a bag and some utensils."
Dylan M.,"Canton, CT",10/24/2016,5.0,Found this gem on Yelp and couldn't be happier. I'd strongly suggest getting a reservation. I ordered the Hangover Hash and am thinking about ordering a second one right now...
Rob K.,"Green Bay, WI",6/21/2015,5.0,"We were her in D.C. on May 28thThe Devil-ish eggs seemed enough alone to rank this place as I do. Service was pleasant and attentive. The Mahi Mahi was fresh and seasoned just right. Nothing we both ordered had any issues at all. Cooked properly and frankly awesome.strong drinks, excellent menu, service was good too"
Aisha Q.,"Blythewood, SC",7/26/2016,5.0,Made reservations here for last Wednesday and my party was seated right on time. I highly suggest trying the different breads they have. I love their corn bread. My fav appetizers are the pepper wings and green tomatoes. Those are definitely the best!For my meal I ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans. I could of just a plate of mashed potatoes...very good! The meatloaf was nicely seasoned and was huge! Definitely had to take left overs. The green beans were nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. Although the desserts looked delicious...I didn't save any room. This place is definitely worth it!
Diana L.,"North Miami, FL",6/26/2016,4.0,"I just realized that I posted pics for this and never completed a review, so here it goes! Another yelper recommended this place to me! And wow I was not disappointed! I was in DC for the weekend and decided to make sure I fitted this restaurant in my schedule. Make sure you book reservations well in advance, cause we almost didn't get any a week before! We ended up having lunch around 3pm since it was the only time available a week in advance. The waitress was alright, she didn't seem to be all there but hey it wasn't bad service. The drinks are pricey but well worth your money, since they do put enough alcohol. The waffles and chickens, you had to try since it's what everyone post that you should try! I did like it, but it was way too much chicken! The atmosphere is awesome since it's a bit loud you can have some good loud laughs and no one is going to look at you weird. I tried other people's dishes and they were pretty good as well! If in the area, you have to try this place!"
Vivian L.,"San Francisco, CA",2/12/2017,4.0,"We booked through Open table, so we were seated very promptly. The food was good, but feels that this place is a tad bit hyped. We had deviled eggs, and two burgers. I didn't feel that they had many lunch selections. But this place was packed when we came!"
Christine T.,"Reston, VA",12/18/2015,4.0,"I've been to this particular location a few times and I swear its always busy regardless of what time it is.  I had the pot roast here which was excellent, a nice flavor but I will preface that the portion was an average size or I was just super hungry because I ate everything on my plate.  The ambiance at this location is nice but its noisy and for as but as it was during the time we were there I almost felt kind of rushed to shovel the food in my mouth and get out so they could accommodate the next reservation.  However, on the whole I did enjoy my meal and really hope I'll continue to explore the Founding Farmers menu."
karina l.,"Brooklyn, NY",11/20/2016,5.0,"Wow! Food  was delicious! Came out quick, maybe a little too quick. Every single thing we ordered which was 6 appetizers and 2 entrees. Fish was flakey and fresh. Farm breads were divine, especially the prosciutto and brie breads."
Edward H.,"Pleasanton, CA",4/6/2017,5.0,"So far, best meal in DC.  Fried chicken and waffles, macaroni and cheese with candied carrots.  Heading for the museums we needed a little ballast in the tanks.  I'd had a hankering for some waffles and fried chicken and I'm sure glad I got it here. Damn, the chicken was so moist and tender and not over salted, the Mac and cheese was just cheesy enough and the waffles were super light and crispy.  We have two days left and we all lamented that we wished we ate here sooner than day five.  Tomorrow I'm getting up early so I can do their breakfast.  Service was top notch.  If you're on the fence about eating here, climb on down and get in here.  You will be glad you did."

Updated review",2.0,"This is not the Founding Farmers I remember from 2012. The food went from great to mediocre and the cocktails were off. I ordered the Bone again and it had way too much lime juice in it - very sour and bitter.Service has declined as well. We were seated almost an hour after our reservation. We were given free appetizers for the table, which was nice, but I don't think I'll be back to this location anytime soon."
Angela M.,"Museum District, Houston, TX",3/12/2017,5.0,"Fried green tomatoes were crispy and juicy with great homemade goat cheese and green goddess dipping sauces.  Lobster Mac was very good with large chunks of meat.  Chicken chili was hearty and tasty.  The pot roast was out of this world, more like a hearty stew bursting with flavor and meat that melts in your mouth.  The chocolate mousse cake was intense, but the homemade white chocolate raspberry cheesecake ice cream was literally the best I've ever eaten!"
Marian S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4/20/2015,5.0,"The food here was soooo amazing! I give this place 4.5 stars. I was visiting from California, and heard so many good things about this place. Originally, my friend and I didn't have reservations, but luckily, we were able to make reservations the night before! Apparently, that is unheard of, and it is almost impossible to get reservations that late. However, the waiter told us if we had one more person, we probably wouldn't have gotten so lucky.I decided to order the chicken and waffles because everyone recommended it for my first time. The chicken was really tasty, the green beans were flavorful, the waffles were light and fluffy, and the mac n cheese was... cheesey. I ate it all and I wasn't uncomfortably full afterwards! That's how you know it's good quality food.I would definitely come here again next time I'm in DC!"
Charlotte R.,"Wilmington, NC",1/20/2017,4.0,The food is delicious and the restaurant is beautiful. Only took off a star because I thought it was a bit overpriced.
Ally S.,"Washington, DC",2/27/2016,3.0,"Haven't been able to figure out what all the raving around this place is all about. Founding Farmers was recommended to us by no less than 4 people. Maybe we caught it on an off night or maybe others just don't know quality of food and service.FF was average at best. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie which was decent but had pieces of really fatty chicken in the bowl. @krisnessa ordered the 8oz filet and was VERY disappointed. After specifying she wanted it with punk in middle, it came out well done. ZERO pink and rough/tough meat.Service was inattentive and constant reminders of refills was needed. No salt and pepper on the table and sat in the walk way and was constantly bumped by every passing stranger. Very disappointed."
P M.,"Buena Park, CA",8/17/2016,5.0,"Killer service, great food and fantastic drinks. Food: Seafood BucatiniDrinks: Doc Holiday & Sazerac"
Bambi M.,"Laguna Beach, CA",7/7/2016,2.0,"Be warned, this will likely be an unpopular review. This vacation, we've reaffirmed just how fortunate we are to live in California with plenty of options, flavored and fresh food. Service: Sub Par, inattentive and unfriendly. Not interested in how our meal progressed and showed no appreciation for our business or visit. Food: Just OK overall, a few standouts but mostly bland. Mussels: Good, but missing a little something. Seafood Deviled Eggs: Good.Cornbread: Good, but missing a tiny something. Mushroom Risotto: BlandTrout (Napa Style) Cooked perfectly, just a bit bland. Steak/Enchilada: Steak was very good. Enchilada was fine. Short Ribs: Very Good. Irritation: Brought our cucumbers instead of watermelon, and took the cucumbers. Really? You can't even resell them, so why not just leave the tiny bowl there? Entrees brought before we were starter plates were cleared and so we bussed our own table. Server not friendly, runner was asked for flatware but runner heard flatbread and then blamed us for using the wrong term. She preferred utensils. (Really?).So.... Yeah. Disappointing. I would not visit again, or recommend to others."
Lorin C.,"Broomfield, CO",4/5/2017,5.0,"Was in DC on Spring Break vacation and ate here with my middle school aged son.  He had a burger and loved it.  I had the Yankee Pot Roast, which was fabulous!  Highly recommended!"
Rel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9/6/2016,5.0,"Found this restaurant on Yelp, it got great reviews for its skillet cornbread and chicken and waffles. So of course that's what I ordered. The service was excellent our waiter had a very calm tone and was easy to communicate with and made an excellent suggestion on the alcohol(blackberry whiskey sour). The food came out really good especially the chicken and waffles I truly enjoyed it. The cornbread threw me off a bit. It wasn't bad just different, I'm used to straight cornbread and not one with kernels in it. My request if you are not up to it, just ask for the corn kernels removed from the cornbread. But it was a great location and restaurant."
Dhru B.,"Vienna, VA",6/7/2016,2.0,"Sorry to say, but my one word summary for Founding Farmers is: overrated.Founding Farmers may be the hottest name in town, hence naturally we wanted to try it. Well, we did and we weren't impressed. We made a reservation for brunch on OpenTable, and still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. The service was slow and we barely could get our waiter's attention throughout the meal.  I figured that was to be expected for such a popular place, but wouldn't the food be the best part for one of the city's most hyped restaurants? Well, the food was disappointing too. The menu seemed to contain standard fare and simple dishes, certainly nothing that ""Wowed!"" me. The hyped devil's eggs in particular weren't exactly special and had no taste to them. There are other places with more creative food than this place. Overall, I don't understand the hype for this place, as there was nothing spectacular about it.  Well, maybe I'll give them points for the decor."
Esha K.,"Madison, WI",4/4/2017,3.0,"We made a reservation for dinner weeks before our visit and we're very disappointed to wait until 45 minutes after our reservation to be seated. Our server forgot to put in the order for our appetizer and was extremely slow to respond to our requests. Was not at all pleased with the service we received here, but the food was decent. I ordered the chicken and waffles which were great although some of the chicken was undercooked. The waffle and sweet potato side were excellent. Perhaps the best part of the meal was the housemade cornbread!"
Rob K.,"Denver, CO",10/17/2016,4.0,Yowsa long line up to get in. Thank God we made reservations but we still had to wait a little bit because we got there early. The place was packed indicating it's an excellent restaurant. It's the farm to table concept popularized first in California. The food was hot and tasty and you will come of there stuffed.I do have a notice for management however. We came twice in 24 hours and on both occasions there was no cutlery on the table and no napkins. Thankfully I had a pocket full of paper napkins to use.
Kamya R.,"Washington, DC",10/16/2016,5.0,"I have enjoyed both brunch and dinner here and loved the food both times! For brunch I highly recommend the shrimp and grits. It's a sure bet since who doesn't enjoy creamy, cheesy grits?For dinner I have had the goat cheese ravioli with chicken cutlet. It doesn't seem super exciting but is probably one of the most underrated items on the menu. The ambiance and great service also add to the meal."
Michael L.,"Washington, DC",4/3/2017,5.0,There is nothing bad to say about this place.  I've never had anything on the menu I didn't like.  Best brunch in DC!!
Kabeer A.,"Helena, AL",9/3/2016,4.0,Really good food. I did not have to wait at all. I made online reservation. The fried chicken was a bit dry. Everything else was great.
Mike H.,"Brewster, MA",9/21/2016,5.0,"As we waited for a table Chef Robert Irvine walked in and I figured it would step up the chef's game. Waitress was great, I ordered the salt crusted prime rib which is my favorite dish and Lawry's in Chicago was my favorite place for prime rib but this was unreal and was better. The Mac N cheese is unique  and perfect with the whipped red potatoes couldn't complement the horseradish cream sauce any better. Dessert and drinks were both as good as it gets I next time in DC it will be my first stop."
Patrick M.,"Washington, DC",6/9/2016,1.0,"As with so many tourist stops in other cities, the Yelp ratings for Founding Farmers are totally off base. This place is highly mediocre and overpriced. If you agree, give it the rating it deserves. I will say the space is nice. That's it."
Amy L.,"San Jose, CA",9/20/2016,5.0,"Ah, this place will always have a spot in my heart. Had a farewell dinner here to a group of my friends who were here on exchange. We were a party of 11 and our server did an amazing job with how busy the restaurant was despite closing hour being an hour away. We were seated on the second floor which was quieter, which was a great atmosphere to have a dinner with some great friends. The food here is great, but what's even better are the portions! My friend and I split the fried green tomatoes which were just as good as everyone on Yelp had reviewed. I had the avocado bacon burger but what I realized was I should have gotten the fried chicken and waffles because that dish was glorious. 4 stars for the food but an extra star for the superb service and how sweet the staff was for not rushing us through our meal even though you could tell they were closing down. FF is worth a visit if you're in DC!"
Ola G.,"Arlington, VA",12/16/2016,2.0,Food was solid- but not mind-blowing.  Service is terrible. Front is crowded with waiting people which really messes with the vibe of your meal. Won't be back- unless someone else has an event rhe
Jessica D.,"Bayside, NY",7/24/2016,4.0,"I have an unnatural obsession with food network, so I naturally had to come here while vacationing this weekend in DC, after seeing it on the best thing I ever ate and on meat and potatoes. My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday around 8 and had about a 45-50 minute wait until we were seated. We decided to hangout at the bar until our table was ready. While at the bar, we had some wine which was a bit expensive. Once we were seated, we decided on the cornbread to start with. It was really good but felt like it was missing a little something to really make it great. It was almost like a corn pudding which was nice. Nonetheless, we cleaned the skillet. As for our entrees, we were so torn as to what to get. We were debating between the steak, the steak and enchiladas, the meatloaf, the pot roast, or the surf and turf. My boyfriend decided on the steak and enchiladas, which he was very excited for, when the waiter came back out and said that they ran out! He switched his order to meatloaf with mashed potatoes. I went with the Yankee pot roast. His meatloaf was tasty and the mashed potatoes were delicious. I had the same mashed potatoes under my pot roast. The pot roast was awesome. Such a hit the spot meal. I could imagine this tasting even better on a cold night and not a 103 degree July night, but still delicious either way. The only thing I didn't love was there's a slight hint of cinnamon in the gravy, but nothing overpowering at all. I wish I could come to DC once a week to try something new from the Founding Farmers menu. Definitely give it a try!"
Jason A.,"Washington, DC",6/15/2016,2.0,"""Meh. I've experienced better."" Is exactly how I would put it. The food is at best good, not great. The drinks are also only good, not great, and really expensive. The crowds at the restaurant get really annoying pretty much every time of the year. For some reason, its the ""go to"" restaurant in that area. During the school year, its always packed with students and parents ""experiencing"" DC area cuisine. During the summer, its slammed with tourists and the few interns that can afford a meal.I think for these reasons it has allowed the service at the restaurant to really, really slump. I've only been a small number of times, but I've never had great service. Like everything else at this restaurant, the service is at best good, not great. Its extremely overrated and I would highly recommend heading elsewhere."
Ana N.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",6/26/2017,5.0,This was our favorite breakfast spot. We went three times and everything we tried was delicious. If you don't make a reservation the wait can be long but definitely worth it.
Nikki P.,"Washington, DC",7/9/2016,3.0,"A great place to take DC visitors who want to feel foodie but can't really deal. The menu is full of comfort food and there is something for everyone. Their beer list is good and every cocktail I've had has been good. Brunch is okay here through coffee is very overpriced. The wait is atrocious, sometimes even if you have a reservation. Service has never been anything special and servers seem intent on repeating a memorized script to you."
Janet W.,"Portland, OR",8/31/2016,5.0,"Even though it was a Monday, based on the reviews, we made a reservation for lunch.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time of 11:00.  Our server was attentive and very helpful with explaining menu items to us.The food was all delicious.  I would have to say that the kitchen is a bit slow, but other than that the service was great.The burger ordered medium was served fairly rare.  Maybe it's an east coast thing?  It seemed that throughout our trip, things were undercooked by our west coast standards.  Not sure.I would love to return for breakfast or lunch.  As long as you're not in a hurry, this is a perfect spot."
Maithili S.,"Gainesville, FL",2/19/2017,4.0,"Excellent food. French toast was one of the best I've had. It has a cream filling which makes it decadent. Loved the chicken sausage! Had a reservation, not otherwise wait times can be pretty long."
Victoria V.,"Port Murray, NJ",4/15/2017,5.0,Fantastic food - love the bacon lollies and the corn bread! A DC favoriteService was excellent and enjoyed the pastrami hash for breakfast. Order the blackberry sour. Perfect!
Quaker W.,"McLean, VA",6/13/2016,3.0,"The marketers that put this chain together have done a brilliant job of packaging it, and I understand the appeal, but don't be confused. ""Farm-to-table"" has become a euphemism for chef-driven and healthy, and Founding Farmers shoves it in your face at every turn, but this restaurant is neither. To be clear, here's what you really get at Founding Farmers:1) Fairly priced chain restaurant food in huge portions2) Lots of decent bread3) Very good drinksStick to what's simple: Farm bread, kettle corn, salads, simply-prepared fish and chicken dishes, sandwiches.Avoid the gooey, cheesy, fried, or overly-complicated upsell items that are relentlessly pushed by the waiters. Corn bread, crab dip, cheese-stuffed and -topped this and that, deep fried entrees, vegetables, and desserts, fried sandwiches, burgers. Call it comfort food if you like. It's bar food. Decent enough, but not worth waiting in line for with all the superior restaurants in the area.Regarding the waitstaff, I've been dragged here 3 or 4 times and have yet to encounter an experienced waiter. Could be my luck, but they have not been well-trained."
Mike B.,"Lancaster, CA",1/7/2016,4.0,"Upon entering the place, I found that it was extremely crowded and very loud.  It took me a few minutes to get to the hostess because of the crowd.  She said that the wait would be about 40 to 45 minutes.  I told her that I could wait.  I was called in about 10 to 15 minutes.  Nice!  I was sat down, and ordered the Boneless Ribeye.  It was a bit small but quite tasty!  I think I'll be back!"
Chris I.,United Kingdom,4/4/2015,5.0,"Grabbed a seat at the bar for breakfast here.  Was lucky as I didn't have a reservation - there was an hours wait for tables!  Would recommend going for the bar option!Good was really good.  Had eggs over easy, bacon, leak hashed browns and toast, with a pork sausage side.  All was super tasty!Service was really attentive.  Greg value for money.Would definitely recommend as a breakfast / brunch venue if in downtown DC."
Shannon C.,"Prairieville, LA",2/18/2017,3.0,"I've heard so much about this restaurant so I decided to try it. Unfortunately I couldn't make reservations because they didn't have anything available for another 2 days. By that point my trip would be over so I just decided to wait. Big mistake! We were quoted a wait time of 1 hr to 1 hr 15 mins. We ended up waiting 2hrs. We ordered French toast and eggs. Our food came quickly, however it was just ok. Definitely not worth the wait."
Mylo D.,"Richmond, VA",1/3/2017,3.0,"Make reservations a head of time if you don't want to wait. The brunch was ok, but the drinks there were perfectly made and delicious!"
Demetria C.,"Arlington, VA",5/26/2015,5.0,"Easily one of my favorite places - I will continue to spend my money here, especially when I have new guests in town.I'm a huge fan of farm to table dining, and Founding Farmers does not disappoint. Their drink choices are insane, even broken down by specific spirit choices - Try the Blackberry sour if you're a whiskey fan :).The Beef Stew, Chicken Pot Pie, Mushroom Sausage Gnocchi, their Fig/Proscuitto flatbread .. the list goes on and on. Don't be afraid to try new things here - I haven't come across something that I didn't like!"
Liz Y.,"Washington, DC",3/19/2017,4.0,"Decent brunch, amazing cornbread- had actual bits of corn! A little too greasy for my preference, I'm a bigger fan of Ted's Bulletin!"
Adderlyn L.,"West Bronx, NY",3/19/2017,5.0,"The pancakes taste homemade! And the hot chocolate is so rich and tasty. Great food and service from a friendly staff. The tall fellow was very nice and funny. We went during Saturday lunch hour and it was packed! Make sure to make a reservation if you can, but the bar is first come, first serve so that was a plus."
Troy U.,"Washington, DC",2/7/2017,5.0,"One of our favorites.  Had lazy dinners, birthdays, and all sorts of other meals here.  So delicious.  Only downside can be the long wait times."
Sharon M.,"Mendham, NJ",6/17/2017,1.0,"Went to have a nice brunch with the family. They brought food for 3 of us but nothing for the 4th. Waitress avoided us and would not even come back to see if we needed butter or jam for toast. While waiting 15 minutes for 4th person's meal, we had to get up and try to find the manager or waitress and still took 15 minutes for food to arrive. Everyone else was done eating before her food arrived. Waitress seemed annoyed that we even asked her where the missing meal was."
Amber E.,"Bronxville, NY",4/13/2017,3.0,"Pretty solid spot. Had a 6pm reservation on a Thursday light and the place was already packed. We were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time. We had the cornbread and eggs to start. The cornbread with the honey butter was great but I will probably pass on the eggs next time. Our drinks also did not arrive until we were well into our appetizers. For our mains we had the cedar plank salmon which was excellent and the shrimp bucatini also a great dish. They were out of Brussels sprouts so I opted for the green beans instead :( We wanted to order the beignets for desert but the waiter informed us it would be 20 minutes to make so we decided to order the cheesecake based on his recommendation. Cheesecake was good but not nearly as good as juniors in NYC. Overall would do it again due to its proximity to the mall and reasonable prices, but don't expect mind blowing food here."
